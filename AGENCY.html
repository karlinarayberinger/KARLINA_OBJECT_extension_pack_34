<p><em>An all-encompassing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a> would be an unchanging set whose elements are every imaginable space-<a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> continuum (populated with every imaginable configuration of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a>).</em></p>
<p><em>Agency is carving exactly one linear path through that all-encompassing multiverse through a temporally linear (and always forward-moving) succession of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decisions</a> being made (or, more generally, of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithms</a> being implemented).</em></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>AGENCY:</strong> an information processing agent appearing to itself to have some degree of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control</a> over which phenomena appear and which phenomena disappear inside of that information processing agent’s frame of reference as time elapses according to that particular frame of reference.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INFORMATION_PROCESSING_AGENT:</strong> a partition of  <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> which is smaller than the whole of nature and which takes the form of some allocation of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a>, and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> and which renders perceptions, makes decisions (using a process of elimination to reduce multiple behavior options down to exactly one option), and executes such decision-making outcomes as (apparently (to itself)) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voluntary</a> behaviors in order to attain that information processing agent’s goals.</p>
<p>An information processing agent is essentially a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer</a> which is capable of learning from its experiences as time elapses along that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing space-time continuum. In particular, that information processing agent accumulates memories which enable that information processing agent to notice <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patterns</a> about which types of phenomena appear to be <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causally</a> related such that the information processing agent can infer which behaviors are most <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/probability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probabilistically</a> likely to enable that information processing agent to achieve its goals.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:</strong> a set of phenomena which an information processing agent renders and perceives as being external (yet phenomenologically all-encompassing) to that information processing agent’s spatially finite and temporally finite body.</p>
<p>Generally, what distinguishes an information processing agent&#8217;s environment from that information processing agent&#8217;s body is the degree of control which that information processing agent appears to itself to exert on either of such things (and the body of that information processing agent tends to be perceived by that information processing agent as being the closest object to that information processing agent&#8217;s locus of perception).</p> 
<p>In order for an information processing agent to take the form of a physical object within a physical <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universe</a>, that information processing agent would presumably need to &#8220;directly&#8221; control some object, X, comprised of a finite (and unique) allocation (and permutation) of matter, energy, space, and time yet lack such (&#8220;direct&#8221;) control over the movements or transformations of any objects which are not determined by that information processing agent to be part of X (and X would necessarily constitute that information processing agent&#8217;s means for perceiving its environment and for interacting with its environment (i.e. &#8220;indirectly&#8221; controlling its environment)).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>BODY:</strong> a vehicle which an information processing agent controls the movements of and which enables that information processing agent to perceive its encompassing environment via sensory input devices.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for an information processing agent to perceive the absence of a boundary between its body and its environment (or even to perceive that it has no body). If that is the case, that information processing agent would perceive itself as having agency if and only if that information processing agent appears to itself to have some non-trivial degree of control over which phenomena appear and which phenomena disappear inside of that information processing agent’s frame of reference as time elapses according to that frame of reference.</p>
<p><strong><em>The degree to which an information processing agent perceives itself as having control over the movements or transformations of any object (within its body or environment) is directly proportional to the number of times that information processing agent observes events occurring which effectively amount to that information processing agent&#8217;s goals being achieved.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> a set of environmental conditions which an information processing agent imagines (and which are not yet being observed by that information processing agent as features of that information processing agent&#8217;s current environment) and which compel that information processing agent to select specific thoughts and behaviors which that information processing agent thinks will be sufficiently likely to cause those imagined environmental conditions to manifest as phenomena in that information processing agent&#8217;s environment (and be rendered in that information processing agent&#8217;s frame of reference) at a specific &#8220;point&#8221; in that information processing agent&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>An example of rudimentary goal-oriented behavior is a C++ program which sets an int type variable named X to some <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a> integer using a specific function which returns an int type value and then, if the value of X is not equal to the &#8220;goal state&#8221; of 9, that random integer function will be called at least one more time such that the value of X will be set to the value returned by that function until the value of X is equal to the &#8220;goal state&#8221; of 9 (essentially through an iterative process of elimination).</p>
<pre>
int GOAL = 9; // The GOAL value does not determine exactly how many times the while loop in the program will be executed when the code is executed by a computer. Instead, the GOAL value constrains the computer's behavior such that the while loop stops looping if and when the GOAL value is obtained by X.
int X = generate_random_integer();
while (X != GOAL) X = generate_random_integer(); // The generate_random_integer() function is called indefinitely many times until the value stored in X is equal to the value stored in GOAL.
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>PERCEPTION:</strong> an information processing agent rendering phenomena inside of that agent’s frame of reference as a result of that information processing agent (a) receiving “low level” (i.e. relatively concrete) sensory input data through that information processing agent’s sensory apparatus, (b) retrieving “middle level” sensory and conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent previously encoded and stored as memories inside of that information processing agent’s long-term memory apparatus, and (c) generating “high level” (i.e. relatively abstract) conceptual throughput data which that information processing agent synthesizes from retrieved memories and from incoming sensory input using that information processing agent&#8217;s short-term memory apparatus.</p>
<pre>/**
 * An information processing agent’s most 
 * recent perception could be described as a

 * (or, if that information processing agent

 * pre-agential factors in that information processing
 * agent's temporally larger encompassing environment).
 */
perception := execution(time_i). // perception occurs at time_i + 1
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>DECISION:</strong> an information processing agent (a) imagining a finite set of multiple options for how that information processing agent could behave in order to achieve that information processing agent&#8217;s goals and then (b) using an algorithmic process of elimination to reduce that set of options down to exactly one option (and that one remaining option is what the information processing agent selects as the planned action to physically implement).</p>

 * recent decision could be described as a

 * processing agent’s most recent perception.

decision := perception(time_i). // decision occurs at time_i + 1
</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>EXECUTION:</strong> an information processing agent performing <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical work</a> by manipulating objects in that information processing agent&#8217;s physical environment (including that information processing agent&#8217;s own body) in order to implement a behavior at time X (and immediately after that information processing agent imagined a set of multiple different behaviors which that information processing agent could select exactly one of to implement at time X in order to achieve that information processing agent&#8217;s goals).</p>
<pre>/**
 * An information processing agent’s most
 * recent execution could be described as a

 * processing agent’s most recent decision.
