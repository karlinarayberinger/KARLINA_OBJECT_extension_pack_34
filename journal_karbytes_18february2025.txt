22_FEBRUARY_2025: On 22_FEBRUARY_2025 at approximately 1:30AM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes re-opened raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 to update the following files (which reference all of the GitHub-hosted files comprising that "micro directory") after karbytes noticed that some of the GitHub-hosted files whose (raw) hyperlinks were not listed in the order those files are listed in within the respective GitHub repository (which is case-sensitive alphabetical order). After that update was completed, karbytes closed raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 to further changes and hopes and expects that raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 will remain immutable after 2:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 22_FEBRUARY_2025.

On 18_FEBRUARY_2025 at approximately 10:00PM Pacific Standard Time karbytes noticed that there was at least one instance of the text sequence "image_link:" occurring on the home page (i.e. START_PAGE) of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and, within an hour of noticing that, karbytes changed those instances of "image_link:" to "image_file:" in order to keep the content patterns consistent throughout that website.

Also, within that same hour, karbytes updated the GitHub repository associated with the "template micro directory" named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 such that the following constituent files have been updated in accordance with the latest change to Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com:

(Note that the "micro directory" source code file listed immediately above this line of text was updated in order to include a missing hyperlink reference to the plain-text file in the respective repository named karlina_object_updates.txt (and karbytes noticed that file's respective hyperlink reference was missing from the respective "micro directory" web page during the aforementioned time period (i.e. the time period between 10:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_FEBRUARY_2025 and 11:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_FEBRUARY_2025))).

(Note that the "micro directory" named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 is closed to further changes after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_FEBRUARY_2025 (despite the fact that karbytes said (across various files in raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_32, raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33, and raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34) that raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_33 was closed to further changes after the finalization of the M_DISC edition named karbytes2025_6)).
