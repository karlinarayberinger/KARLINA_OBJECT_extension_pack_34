Earlier today I had the thought that every person, deep down, knows everything and that all physics is basically "cartoon logic" being willed into existence by those who prefer it (especially because such physics precisely are what enable them to live).

By "physics" I mean the observed and theorized configuration of matter and energy at any given point in time within the universe karbytes lives and, also, the allegedly unconditional (within the context of the aforementioned universe) rules which describe precisely and conclusively how non-identical partitions of that universe interact with each other (at any specific and finite period of time within the entire timeline of that entire universe's lifespan).
