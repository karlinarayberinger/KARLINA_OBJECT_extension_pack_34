"Abuse" and "mistreatment" are words we do not take seriously because those words imply subjective notions of morality (and such notions are mere personal opinions (whether sincerely held by at least one person or else entirely hypothetical ideals)).

"Bad" and "good" are also words which imply subjective notions of what is deemed to be ideal (and which pertain to a particular (actual and/or hypothetical) "moral compass" configuration).

"Right" and "wrong" are synonymous with "good" and "bad" respectively.

A could say that B is being abusive to C while D could say that B is not being abusive to C.

The previous sentence implies that D thinks that A is complaining that B is not adhering to A's opinions of what is morally correct behavior.

The sentence prior to the previous sentence (and the previous sentence) imply that only A and possibly C are upset by B's behavior while D thinks that A is fine to continue treating B the way A is and the way which A is complaining about.

Even if C agreed with A, if D has more political power (and the military prowess to enforce it) than either A or C, it is likely that B will continue to be allowed to "mistreat" C according to A.
