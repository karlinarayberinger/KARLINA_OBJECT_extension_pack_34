karbytes:

Earlier in this conversation you mentioned that there have been experiments conducted which involve quantum entanglement and which seem to suggest that future events can effect past events. Please elaborate.

ChatGPT:

Yes‚Äîthis is one of the most fascinating and controversial areas in the foundations of quantum physics. The idea that future events can affect past events is often referred to as retrocausality, and it‚Äôs been explored through both thought experiments and actual quantum experiments, especially those involving quantum entanglement, delayed choice, and quantum eraser setups.

Let‚Äôs break this down with a few key experiments:

üîπ 1. Delayed Choice Experiment (Wheeler‚Äôs Delayed Choice)

Setup:

- Proposed by physicist John Archibald Wheeler in the 1970s.

- A photon is sent through a double-slit-like apparatus.

- After the photon has passed the slit(s), the experimenter chooses whether to observe which path it took or allow it to interfere like a wave.

Weird part:

- The choice to observe or not can be made after the photon has already passed the slits.

- Yet the results behave as though the photon "knew" ahead of time what the experimenter would choose.

Implication:

- Some interpretations suggest that the future measurement choice determines the past behavior of the photon.

üîπ 2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

This is a more developed version of Wheeler‚Äôs delayed choice.

Setup:

- Entangled photon pairs are created.

- One photon goes directly to a detector (we'll call it the "signal photon").

- The other photon (the "idler") takes a longer, more complex path where experimenters may or may not erase which-path information after the signal photon has already been detected.

Weird part:

- If the which-path information is erased for the idler, the signal photon (already detected) shows an interference pattern.

- If the which-path info is preserved, the interference disappears‚Äîeven though the signal photon has already hit the detector.

Implication:

- Again, it looks as though a future action (erasing or not erasing) affects what already happened to the other photon.

üîπ 3. Entanglement and Bell Test Experiments

Bell test experiments are used to test whether quantum entanglement allows for ‚Äúhidden variables‚Äù that pre-determine outcomes.

Setup:

- Two entangled particles are sent to distant detectors.

- Experimenters randomly choose measurement settings after the particles are in flight.

Weird part:

- The results are correlated in ways that violate Bell inequalities, suggesting non-locality or retrocausality‚Äîdepending on your interpretation.

Implication:

- Some interpretations (like the retrocausal interpretation) propose that the measurement setting in the future could be influencing the state of the particle in the past.

üîπ Interpretations That Allow Retrocausality

These experiments don‚Äôt prove retrocausality, but they are compatible with it, depending on the framework:

- Transactional Interpretation (by John Cramer): Uses a "handshake" between past and future waves (retarded and advanced waves).

- Two-State Vector Formalism (Aharonov and Vaidman): Describes quantum systems as being determined by both past and future boundary conditions.

- Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics: Proposes the laws of physics work the same forwards and backwards in time.

üß† So, Can the Future Really Affect the Past?

The mainstream view is no, in the sense of classical causality‚Äîbut quantum mechanics allows for strange correlations that challenge our intuition about time and causation. Whether those imply true retrocausality or just non-local correlations depends on your chosen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Would you like me to illustrate any of these experiments visually or with a specific timeline example?

karbytes:

What do you mean by non-local correlations?

ChatGPT:

Great question.

üß© Non-local correlations refer to the idea that two or more quantum particles can display instantaneous, coordinated behavior, even when separated by large distances‚Äîwithout any signal traveling between them at or below the speed of light.

This phenomenon is most famously seen in quantum entanglement.

üîó Example of Non-Local Correlations

Let‚Äôs say you have two entangled particles: A and B.

- They're created together in a way that their properties are linked (e.g., their spins must be opposite).

- You send particle A to Alice on Earth and particle B to Bob on the Moon.

Now suppose Alice measures the spin of particle A and finds it‚Äôs ‚Äúup.‚Äù

- Instantly, she knows Bob will find particle B‚Äôs spin to be ‚Äúdown.‚Äù

This result is correlated. But here‚Äôs the kicker:

- It doesn‚Äôt matter how far apart Alice and Bob are.

- The result is instantaneous, despite the fact that no signal can travel faster than light.

üö´ Why It‚Äôs Not Classical Communication

This does not allow for faster-than-light communication because:

- The outcome is random. Alice can‚Äôt control what result she gets to send a message to Bob.

- Bob‚Äôs result is also random‚Äîbut correlated with Alice‚Äôs if they compare notes after the fact.

üéØ Bell's Theorem and "Spooky Action"

Einstein called this ‚Äúspooky action at a distance,‚Äù and tried to explain it using ‚Äúhidden variables‚Äù‚Äîpre-determined outcomes.

But Bell‚Äôs Theorem (1964) proved that:

- Any hidden-variable theory that preserves local realism cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.

And experiments (called Bell test experiments) have repeatedly confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, violating Bell inequalities.

This strongly suggests one of two things:

- Locality is violated (non-locality is real).

- Reality isn't determined until measurement (i.e., outcomes are fundamentally indeterminate until observed).

üîÑ Non-Locality vs. Retrocausality

Here‚Äôs the subtle difference:

- Non-locality means: The measurement on one particle is correlated with another, instantly, at a distance.

- Retrocausality suggests: A future measurement influences a past event.

Some interpretations see non-local correlations as evidence of retrocausal influence instead of ‚Äúspooky action.‚Äù

Would you like me to draw a visual or step-by-step timeline of an entanglement example showing these non-local effects?

karbytes:

How about describe in detail the hardware and specific events which occurred during the experiments you described.

ChatGPT:

Certainly! Let's delve into the hardware and specific events of key experiments that explore quantum phenomena like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement, particularly focusing on Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment and the Quantum Eraser Experiment.

1. Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment

Objective: To investigate whether the behavior of a photon (as a wave or particle) is determined at the point of measurement, even if the decision on how to measure is made after the photon has entered the experimental apparatus.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits individual photons toward a beam splitter.

- Beam Splitter (BS1): Splits the photon's path into two possible routes:

+ Path 1: Direct transmission.

+ Path 2: Reflection.

- Mirrors: Redirect the photons from both paths to converge at a second beam splitter (BS2).

- Second Beam Splitter (BS2): Can be inserted or removed after the photon has passed BS1:

- Inserted: Paths recombine, leading to interference patterns indicative of wave behavior.

- Removed: Paths remain separate, allowing determination of the photon's path, indicative of particle behavior.

- Detectors (D1 and D2): Placed at the output ports to record photon arrivals.

Procedure:

- A photon is emitted and encounters BS1, entering a superposition of both paths.

- While the photon is en route, the experimenter decides whether to insert or remove BS2.

- Depending on the presence of BS2:

+ BS2 Inserted: Photons exhibit interference, suggesting wave-like behavior.

+ BS2 Removed: Photons do not interfere, and their path can be determined, suggesting particle-like behavior.

Key Insight: The photon's behavior appears to be influenced by the experimental setup chosen after it has entered the apparatus, challenging classical notions of reality.

2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

Objective: To explore how "which-path" information affects interference patterns and whether erasing this information can restore interference.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits photons toward a double-slit apparatus.

- Double-Slit Apparatus: Allows photons to pass through two slits, creating potential for interference.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystal (e.g., Beta Barium Borate - BBO): Placed after the slits to induce Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), producing entangled photon pairs:

+ Signal Photon: Proceeds to a detection screen (D0).

+ Idler Photon: Directed to a separate path with additional detectors.

+ Detectors (D1, D2, D3, D4): Placed to capture idler photons, with configurations that either preserve or erase which-path information.

Procedure:

- A photon passes through the double-slit and enters the BBO crystal, producing entangled signal and idler photons.

- The signal photon travels to detector D0, forming an initial pattern.

- The idler photon is directed toward detectors D1-D4:

+ D1 & D2: Provide which-path information.

+ D3 & D4: Erase which-path information.

- By correlating detections at D0 with those at D1-D4:

+ Which-Path Known (D1/D2): No interference pattern at D0.

+ Which-Path Erased (D3/D4): Interference pattern observed at D0.

Key Insight: Erasing which-path information after detection can retroactively influence the formation of interference patterns, highlighting the non-classical nature of quantum measurement.

Hardware Components:

- Photon Sources: Lasers capable of emitting single photons.

- Beam Splitters: Devices that divide photon paths probabilistically.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Materials like BBO crystals used for SPDC to generate entangled photons.

- Mirrors and Optical Fibers: Direct photon paths with precision.

- Single-Photon Detectors: Sensitive detectors (e.g., avalanche photodiodes) that register individual photon events.

- Coincidence Counters: Electronic systems that correlate detection events across multiple detectors to identify entangled photon pairs.

Specific Events in the Experiments:

- Photon Emission: A laser emits photons toward the experimental apparatus.

- Path Determination: Photons encounter beam splitters or slits, creating superpositions of possible paths.

- Entanglement Generation: In the quantum eraser setup, nonlinear crystals produce entangled photon pairs via SPDC.

- Detection: Photons are detected by single-photon detectors, with events recorded for analysis.

- Data Correlation: Coincidence counters analyze detection events to identify correlations indicative of interference or which-path information.

Conclusion:

These experiments utilize precise optical components and detection systems to explore foundational questions in quantum mechanics, revealing the intricate and often non-intuitive nature of quantum phenomena.

karbytes:

I'm still not quite getting how photons retroactively alter their trajectories in response to hardware configuration.

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs a very reasonable sticking point‚Äîyou're grappling with one of the deepest puzzles in quantum physics. Let‚Äôs break it down with a step-by-step thought process, and then we‚Äôll talk about what‚Äôs really happening (or what we think is happening).

üí° Core Idea: ‚ÄúRetroactive‚Äù Behavior Isn‚Äôt Classical

When we say a photon ‚Äúretroactively‚Äù alters its behavior, it‚Äôs not like it travels backward in time and changes its trajectory. What‚Äôs happening is this:

üß† The photon‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt seem to be ‚Äúdecided‚Äù until the measurement is made‚Äîeven if that measurement is delayed.

This means the photon doesn‚Äôt act like a particle moving through a well-defined path in spacetime the way a baseball does. Instead, it exists in a kind of superposition of possibilities until measurement.

üî¨ Let's Revisit the Quantum Eraser Setup (with Entangled Photons)

Here‚Äôs how the apparent "retrocausality" happens:

1. Photon pair is created (via SPDC in a BBO crystal):

- One photon (the signal) goes to a detector (D0).

- The other (the idler) takes a more complex path with optional ‚Äúwhich-path‚Äù info.

2. You detect the signal photon at D0.

    You record its location, but you don‚Äôt yet know whether it behaved like a wave or a particle because that depends on whether the idler photon‚Äôs path can be known or not.

3. Later, the idler photon hits a detector (D1‚ÄìD4).

    D1 & D2 preserve which-path info ‚Üí no interference when you look at D0 results linked to them.

    D3 & D4 erase which-path info ‚Üí interference emerges when you correlate those detections with D0.

4. Only after comparing correlated detection events do you see the pattern:

    You only get interference when you group the D0 hits based on D3/D4 events.

üåÄ Why This Feels Like Retrocausality

    You detected the signal photon before you determined if its *entangled partner‚Äôs path info was erased.

    But grouping your data later reveals that the pattern at D0 depends on a future choice (where the idler went).

So it looks like the future is influencing the past.
üß† But Here's a Key Insight:

The photon doesn't have a classical ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù at all. The notion that it ‚Äúwent through slit A or slit B‚Äù is not well-defined until you force it to be by measuring.

    ‚ú® In quantum mechanics, the outcome is not set until it‚Äôs observed. That‚Äôs not just philosophical‚Äîexperiments show this again and again.

So, rather than thinking of the photon as ‚Äúretroactively changing,‚Äù you could say:

    The photon‚Äôs past behavior is undefined until a consistent future measurement gives it meaning.

‚öñÔ∏è Interpretational Options:

Here‚Äôs how different interpretations handle this:
Interpretation  Photon ‚Äúretroactively changes‚Äù? Explanation
Copenhagen  ‚ùå   Measurement collapses wavefunction; past is undefined before then.
Many-Worlds ‚ùå   All possible paths happen; the measurement just tells us which branch we end up in.
Transactional Interpretation    ‚úÖ   Particles exchange waves forward and backward in time to determine outcomes.
Two-State Vector    ‚úÖ   The state is determined by both past and future boundary conditions.
Pilot Wave (Bohmian)    ‚ùå (but weirdly non-local)   The photon has a real path, but a ‚Äúpilot wave‚Äù guides it based on the whole setup.
üö´ What It‚Äôs Not:

    It‚Äôs not a case of light ‚Äúgoing backward in time‚Äù like in science fiction.

    It‚Äôs not a classical particle being affected by a future event.

It‚Äôs that the quantum description is holistic‚Äîwhat we observe depends on how we choose to measure.

Would you like a diagram that walks through the signal and idler photon paths with timing annotations to help visualize the sequence better?
