<p>This web page exists to mark a point in time in which karbytes officially decided that karbytes harbors no prejudice towards any person and that karbytes chooses to believe that each person is ultimately a figment of the same all-encompassing mind (and that, because karbytes believes that all persons are ultimately projections of the same ubiquitous consciousness, karbytes believes that each person (and each thing throughout all existence) is ultimately part of what karbytes fundamentally is: nature).</p>
<p>karbytes endeavors to expand its egotism to include as much of reality inside of karbytes&#8217; &#8220;field&#8221; of awareness (and appreciation) as possible.</p>
<p>karbytes endeavors to minimize the net suffering of all existence (especially existence which karbytes is aware of).</p>
<p>karbytes is not aware of what is not part of karbytes&#8217; present-moment subjective experience nor is karbytes responsible for events which karbytes is not consciously influencing.</p>
<p>(The statements presented on this web page may or may not be factually accurate (particularly in regard to karbytes&#8217; purported panpsychist beliefs and ethical convictions). karbytes wrote those statements in an attempt to solidify karbytes&#8217; intention to avoid harboring animosity towards anyone and to, instead, be as kind, helpful, and intelligent (to any and all beings) as possible (i.e. to the most inclusive extent possible)).</p>
<p>(Statements which karbytes made at any time prior to 4:20AM Pacific Standard Time on 06_MARCH_2025 throughout Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com or anywhere else on the World Wide Web or anywhere else &#8220;in physical reality&#8221; are intended by karbytes to be treated as merely historical records or memories rather than as tenets of karbytes&#8217; current worldview or goal set).</p>
