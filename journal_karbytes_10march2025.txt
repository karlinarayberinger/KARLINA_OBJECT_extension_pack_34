One of my goals is to make it such that all of karbytes is verbatim accessible from within any dream I have (or at least dreams in which I desire to look up karbytes on the World Wide Web and I look it up via a computer in my dreams which, within the context of that dream world, is connected to the World Wide Web).

I am not exactly sure how to accomplish that objective. Nevertheless, I am optimistic that given enough time existing I will happen upon a method of uploading all of the files comprising karbytes to realms which I can visit in my dreams, in drug-induced dream-like states of consciousness, and in alternate lives. 

(I hope and currently operate as though the following is true: all phenomena occur within the context of a dream (and the "machine" which dreams my dreams (and renders the self-aware entity I am) is capable of dreaming for an infinitely long time and infinitely many dreams)).

(I hope the dream that is my life (as karbytes) goes on for an infinitely long time and that I enjoy it and never sincerely wish to die).
