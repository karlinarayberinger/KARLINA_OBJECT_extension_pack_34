Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser (Kim et al. 1999) – Experiment and Results

Experiment Setup (Kim et al., 1999)

In 1999, Yoon-Ho Kim and colleagues performed a “delayed-choice quantum eraser” experiment to test how quantum interference can appear or disappear depending on whether which-path information is retained or “erased.” The setup (schematically illustrated below) involved a double-slit illuminated by an argon laser, producing single photons (351 nm) that pass through either slit A or slit B. After the slits, a nonlinear BBO crystal induces spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), splitting each photon into a pair of entangled photons – one signal photon and one idler photoninterference setup). The idler photon takes a longer path through a system of prisms (PS), beam splitters (BSₐ, BS_b, BS_c), and mirrors (Mₐ, M_b), leading to four possible detectors D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄ on the idler side. Importantly:

D₃ or D₄ (“which-path” detectors): If an idler clicks at D₃, it could only have come from slit B; if it clicks at D₄, it could only have come from slit A. Thus D₃ and D₄ provide which-path information about the signal photon.

D₁ or D₂ (“eraser” detectors): Idlers arriving at D₁ or D₂ have been recombined at BS_c such that their origin is indistinguishable – these detectors erase the which-path information. No single idler at D₁ or D₂ reveals which slit was taken.

The signal detector D₀ is triggered ~8 ns before its entangled idler partner reaches D₁–D₄ (due to shorter path length). A coincidence circuit pairs each D₀ detection with the corresponding idler detection (D₁–D₄). By examining coincident counts (joint detection events), one can post-select subsets of D₀ hits corresponding to a given idler detector. This allows the experimenters to see how the D₀ pattern changes depending on where the idler went, even though D₀ itself, considered alone, shows no clear interference.

Figure 1. Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser Setup (Kim et al. 1999). Simplified diagram of the experiment. A photon passes through a double slit (left), then is split into an entangled signal-idler pair by a BBO crystal. The signal (red or light-blue path) goes to detector D₀. The idler (colored paths going downward) encounters prisms (PS), beam splitters (green) and mirrors (gray), and is ultimately detected at D₁, D₂, D₃ or D₄. Detectors D₃ and D₄ mark the photon’s origin (slit B or A respectively), while D₁ and D₂ erase the which-path information by mixing the paths. A coincidence counter (blue circuits, right) correlates D₀’s signal with each idler detector’s events.

Interference vs. No-Interference in Coincidence Counts

Kim et al. recorded the coincidence count distributions at D₀ conditioned on each idler detector. Strikingly, they found that interference fringes appear or vanish depending on which D detector is heralding the idler:

Interference Patterns (Fringes) – Eraser Conditions: When considering only those D₀ detections whose idler went to D₁ or D₂, an interference pattern emerges in the joint detection rates. In other words, R₀₁ (coincidences D₀&D₁) and R₀₂ (D₀&D₂) each show a wavy, oscillatory distribution as D₀ is scanned. These fringes are analogous to a Young’s double-slit pattern. However, the two patterns are out of phase by π (peaks of R₀₁ align with troughs of R₀₂). This phase shift is due to the differing path lengths/reflections for D₁ vs. D₂ (the beam splitter BS_c causes one subset of coincidences to interfere with a relative phase). Notably, if you sum R₀₁ + R₀₂, the fringes cancel out, yielding a flat distribution. (This combined sum corresponds to ignoring which idler detector clicked – i.e. the total D₀ pattern, which shows no interference, consistent with complementarity.)

No Interference (Clumping) – Which-Path Conditions: In contrast, the subsets of D₀ hits whose idlers went to D₃ or D₄ show no interference pattern. These joint counts – R₀₃ (D₀&D₃) and R₀₄ (D₀&D₄) – exhibit a single broad diffraction envelope (a “blob” distribution) rather than multiple fringes. This is expected because D₃ and D₄ each provide definite which-slit knowledge for every photon, enforcing particle-like behavior with no two-slit interference. In fact, Kim et al. reported “an absence of interference” in R₀₃ (and similarly R₀₄). R₀₃ and R₀₄ were nearly identical apart from a slight shift in the peak position.

Crucially, all four coincidence distributions R₀₁, R₀₂, R₀₃, R₀₄ are recorded simultaneously during one scan of D₀. Only when the data is partitioned by idler outcome do the contrasting patterns emerge – even though every signal photon hit D₀ long before its idler’s detection was registered. This demonstrates the “quantum eraser” idea: whether an interference pattern is present in the signal depends on how the entangled idler is measured later. Yet no information or causation actually travels backward in time; the interference is only visible in the subset selection (after correlating with D₁/D₂), and the total D₀ counts (all idlers combined) show no interference at all.

Figure 2. Joint-Detection Result – No Interference vs Interference. Example of a coincidence count distribution from Kim et al.’s experiment. Shown here is the R₀₄ subset (signal coincidences when the idler went to D₄), displaying a single broad peak – i.e. no interference fringes. In the actual data, the R₀₁ and R₀₂ subsets each showed interference fringes (peaks and troughs) which were phase-shifted relative to each other. By contrast, R₀₃ and R₀₄ yielded only a smooth diffraction profile. (R₀₄ was not explicitly plotted in the original paper; it is assumed to mirror R₀₃.)

Published Figures and Follow-ups

Kim et al.’s original Phys. Rev. Lett. (2000) article included graphs of the coincidence rates: interference fringes for R₀₁ and R₀₂ (Fig. 3 and 4) and a flat distribution for R₀₃ (Fig. 5). The key findings are often depicted in summaries and textbooks. For example, the Wikimedia Commons graphic based on Kim’s data explicitly labels the fringe patterns (R₀₁, R₀₂) versus the “clump” patterns (R₀₃, R₀₄). Many reproductions illustrate that R₀₁ and R₀₂ are complementary interference patterns whose sum recreates the single broad curve of R₀₃/R₀₄. In essence, the interference is there in the conditional data, but hidden in the aggregate. Modern discussions (and even classroom demonstrations) emphasize that selecting subsets by the idler detector is like “filtering” the D₀ hits to reveal interference that is otherwise washed out.

Several follow-up studies and explanations have included helpful diagrams of this effect. One visual approach is to color-code the signal hits by the corresponding idler detector. If one plots D₀’s hits tagged by D₁ (say, red) versus those tagged by D₂ (blue), each forms a fringe pattern shifted relative to the other; but when overlaid they sum to a uniform distribution. Conversely, hits tagged by D₃ or D₄ each just form a single hump (no fringes). This reinforces the idea that interference appears only when which-path information is truly unavailable – even though the “choice” to erase or not erase is made after the signal has hit D₀. The Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment thus elegantly demonstrates how entanglement and measurement selection can recover interference from an entangled particle without violating causality.

karbytes:

In a different conversation you explained how photons can be made to travel significantly slower than the speed of light. Can the speed of electrons also be manipulated in a laboratory?

ChatGPT:

Yes, absolutely — the speed of electrons can be and routinely is manipulated in laboratory settings. In fact, electron velocity control is central to fields like electron microscopy, particle accelerators, semiconductor physics, and quantum optics.

Let’s walk through some core ideas:

🔋 1. Electron Speed Depends on Energy

Unlike photons (which always move at the speed of light in vacuum), electrons have mass, so their speed depends on their kinetic energy.

In the lab, we usually control an electron’s speed by applying an electric potential (voltage):

The electron gains kinetic energy E_k = q * V, where:

q = charge of the electron (~1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C),

V = voltage.

The classical speed (non-relativistic) is:
    
v = square_root((2 * q * V) / m_e)

where m_e is the electron’s mass (~9.11×10⁻³¹ kg).

For example:

1 electron-volt → ~593 km/s

10 keV → ~59,300 km/s

1 MeV → ~94% of light speed (requires relativity)

⚙️ 2. Practical Ways to Slow or Control Electrons

🧲 Electric & Magnetic Fields

- Electrons can be accelerated or decelerated using fields in cathode ray tubes, electron beams, linear accelerators, and RF cavities.

- Magnetic fields don’t change speed directly (they deflect direction), but magnetic lenses are used in electron microscopes to focus and guide electrons.

🧊 Cryogenic Semiconductors

- In semiconductors (especially at cryogenic temperatures), electron drift velocity is reduced due to reduced kinetic energy and lattice interactions.

- Electrons can be trapped or guided through quantum dots, quantum wells, and 2D materials at controlled speeds.

🧬 Cold Electron Sources

- Techniques like photoemission from cooled cathodes produce electrons with very low thermal energy → slower starting speeds.

- Useful in ultrafast electron diffraction and quantum optics.

🌪 Slowing via Matter Waves

- In electron interferometry, electrons are guided slowly enough to exhibit clear wave-like behavior over large scales (think: de Broglie wavelength increases as velocity decreases).

🧪 Advanced: Ultra-Slow Electron Experiments

There are even niche setups (e.g. Rydberg atoms or Penning traps) where electrons are almost motionless, orbiting at large distances or held in magnetic/ionic cages.

- Penning traps: electrons (or ions) are held in place and manipulated using combined static magnetic and electric fields.

- Motional ground state: used in quantum computing with trapped ions or electrons.

How fast do electrons typically orbit the nucleus of an atom?

ChatGPT:

Great question — and the answer gets deep fast! Let’s explore it from both classical and quantum standpoints, since atomic electrons don’t really “orbit” like planets — but we can still estimate their typical speeds in various atoms.

🧮 In the Bohr Model (Hydrogen-like atoms)

In the early Bohr model, electrons are treated as orbiting the nucleus in circular orbits. While not fully quantum accurate, it gives surprisingly good estimates for hydrogen-like atoms (one electron, like H, He⁺, Li²⁺).

For hydrogen (n = 1 energy level), the electron speed is:

v = (Z ⋅ α ⋅ c) / n

Where:

Z = atomic number (1 for hydrogen),

α = fine-structure constant ≈ 1/137,

c = speed of light ≈ 3.00 × (10 ^ 8) m/s,

n = principal quantum number.

🔢 So for hydrogen in the ground state (n=1):

v ≈ (1 / 137) * (3.00 * (10 ^ 8)) ≈ 2.19 * (10 ^ 6) m/s

That’s roughly 2.2 million meters per second, or about 0.0073c (less than 1% the speed of light).

🔬 In Real Quantum Mechanics

In modern quantum theory, electrons exist as probability clouds — they don’t have fixed orbits, but we can still talk about average kinetic energy and thus typical speed.

For the hydrogen ground state wavefunction:

Average kinetic energy ⟨K⟩ = 13.6 / 2 = 6.8 eV.

From this, we estimate:

(1 / 2) * (m * (v ^ 2)) = 6.8 eV ⇒ v ≈ 2.19 * (10 ^ 6) m/s

So quantum mechanics agrees numerically with Bohr — but interprets things differently.

🧨 For Heavier Atoms (Relativistic Speeds!)

For high-Z elements like uranium (Z = 92), inner-shell (1s) electrons move much faster:

v ≈ (Z ⋅ α ⋅ c) / n ⇒ v ≈ (92 / 137) ⋅ c ≈ 0.67 c

That’s 67% the speed of light — so relativistic corrections are required for accuracy in heavy atoms. This speed increase also affects chemistry (e.g., the color of gold and the liquid nature of mercury at room temperature come from relativistic effects on their electrons).

⚡ Summary Table

[preformatted text]

Atom            | Z       Approx. Electron Speed (1s orbital)

Hydrogen        | 1       ~2.2 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.0073c)

Carbon          | 6       ~13 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.043c)

Iron            | 26      ~57 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.19c)

Uranium         | 92      ~2.0 × 10⁸ m/s (~0.67c)

Would you like a visual of these “electron cloud speeds” or a simulation of relativistic vs non-relativistic effects in orbitals?

karbytes:

Do electrons typically travel around the nucleus of an atom in a random manner?

ChatGPT:

That’s an insightful question — and the answer gets to the heart of quantum mechanics and how we think about electrons in atoms.

The short version is:

- Electrons don’t “travel around” the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.
    
- Instead, they exist as quantum probability clouds — and their position and momentum are not simultaneously well-defined.

Let’s break it down:

🔮 1. No Classical Trajectories in Quantum Mechanics

In the classical picture, one might imagine an electron as a tiny ball zipping in circles around the nucleus. That’s intuitive, but not accurate in the quantum world.

In quantum mechanics:

- Electrons are described by wavefunctions (solutions to the Schrödinger equation).

- The square of the wavefunction gives the probability density — i.e., where you're likely to find the electron upon measurement.

- Between measurements, we don't say the electron "is" at a specific point — it’s delocalized.

So: electrons don’t follow a path like an orbit; instead, they form standing wave patterns around the nucleus.

☁️ 2. Atomic Orbitals Are Not Orbits

What we call “orbitals” (1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) are probability distributions.

- A 1s orbital (hydrogen’s ground state) is a spherical cloud — the electron is equally likely to be found in any direction at a given distance from the nucleus.

- A 2p orbital is dumbbell-shaped — showing regions where the electron is more likely to be detected.

- These shapes are fixed by quantum numbers and remain stationary over time unless disturbed.

So rather than moving randomly around the nucleus, the electron exists in a kind of fuzzy, standing wave that defines regions where it’s more or less likely to appear.

🌀 3. Motion Still Exists — But It’s Not Random "Traveling"

Even though electrons don't orbit in the classical sense, they still have kinetic energy and non-zero momentum — especially in excited states.

- Their motion is quantum-mechanical, meaning we can't assign them a definite trajectory.

- In time-dependent interpretations (or under perturbations), the probability cloud can shift, or electron density can “slosh” — but not in a random bouncing-ball way.

🧠 So What Is “Random” About It?

The position where you detect an electron is fundamentally probabilistic:

- You can’t predict exactly where it will be.

- But you can know the probability distribution.

- Over many measurements, the detections will match the orbital shape.

So the randomness is in the outcome of position measurements, not in some erratic motion.

karbytes:

Are electrons or photons ever motionless (i.e. traveling at zero velocity)?

ChatGPT:

Excellent question — and it cuts to the core of how we define motion, energy, and observables in quantum physics.

Let’s tackle photons and electrons separately, since their physical properties and constraints are quite different.

⚛️ PHOTONS: Are Never Motionless

Photons are massless particles, and in physics, massless particles must always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum:

v_photon = c = 299,792,458 m/s

So:

❌ Photons can never be at rest.

❌ There is no reference frame in which a photon is stationary.

✅ They can be slowed down in media (e.g., glass, Bose-Einstein condensates), but this is due to interactions — their fundamental speed remains c between interactions.

🧲 ELECTRONS: Can Be Motionless (in principle)

Electrons have mass, so they can be at rest relative to some reference frame — though this comes with quantum caveats.

🔹 In Classical Physics:

- Yes — an electron at rest has zero velocity and rest energy E=mc2E=mc2.

- You can hold an electron still in, say, an electric trap or vacuum chamber.

🔹 In Quantum Mechanics:

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies:

Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ℏ2

So: if an electron has exactly zero momentum (i.e., is truly motionless), then its position is infinitely uncertain (i.e., it could be anywhere in the universe).

➤ This makes a perfectly motionless electron unphysical.

🔹 But… electrons can be very nearly at rest:

- In Penning or Paul traps, electrons can be confined and cooled to have extremely low kinetic energy.

- In solid-state systems, such as quantum dots, electrons can be trapped in effectively motionless states.

- In Bose-Einstein condensates, electrons within atoms can have very low momenta.

So:

✅ Yes, electrons can be motionless (or nearly so) in a given frame.

But: their wavefunction spreads out, so “motionless” doesn't mean “stuck at a point.”

🧊 Real-World Example: Electrons in a Trap

In a Penning trap (combining electric and magnetic fields):

- Electrons can be cooled to microkelvin temperatures.

- Their thermal motion is drastically reduced.

- They can remain nearly stationary for seconds or more.

particles       | Can Be at Rest?       | Why / Why Not

Photons         | ❌                    | Never Massless ⇒ must travel at c

Electron        | ✅ Sometimes          | Has mass ⇒ can be slowed, but quantum limits apply

What happens to electrons which are trapped in specific data-representing configurations inside of USB flash drives (which are at room temperature (i.e. 20 degrees Celsius) instead of close to zero Kelvin)?

ChatGPT:

Ah, you’ve hit a very cool intersection of solid-state physics, quantum mechanics, and information storage. Let's unpack what happens to electrons trapped in data-storing configurations inside a USB flash drive, especially at room temperature (around 20°C or 293K).

🧠 Summary First:

- In a USB flash drive, electrons are deliberately trapped in tiny insulating regions called floating gates inside transistors.
    
- These trapped charges represent binary data (0s and 1s) — and they stay put, even at room temperature, because the surrounding material is highly insulating and the traps are engineered to hold charge stably for years.

🔌 What is Actually Storing the Data?

USB flash drives use NAND flash memory, which consists of arrays of floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs).

🔹 Each memory cell stores 1 or more bits

- A “1” or “0” is stored by the presence or absence of electrons in a floating gate.

- The floating gate is an electrically isolated conductor (often polysilicon) surrounded by insulating oxide.

- When electrons are injected into this gate (via tunneling), they get stuck — this shifts the threshold voltage of the transistor.

Depending on that voltage shift, a read operation can tell whether the cell holds a 1 or 0.

🔋 How Are Electrons Trapped?

➤ Electron Injection (Write Operation):

- A high voltage is applied, creating a strong electric field.

- Electrons are pushed (via Fowler–Nordheim tunneling or hot-electron injection) through the insulating barrier and into the floating gate.

➤ Electron Retention (Storage):

- Once in the floating gate, electrons are surrounded by insulating material (e.g., silicon dioxide).

- With no conductive path out, the electrons stay trapped — like flies in a glass jar.

🌡️ What Happens at Room Temperature?

At room temperature (∼20°C / 293K):

- Electrons remain trapped in the floating gate.

- Thermal energy (kT ≈ 25 meV) is far too low to knock electrons out of the trap by itself.

- The barriers surrounding the gate are typically several electron-volts high (e.g., 3–5 eV), so spontaneous escape is extremely rare.

- That's why USB drives retain data for years, even in your pocket.

📌 Thermally activated tunneling or leakage is possible but exponentially suppressed unless:

- The device is old or has seen many write/erase cycles (oxide degradation),

- The temperature is extremely high (e.g. > 85°C),

- Or the materials are defective.

💥 How Long Do They Last?

Typical data retention specs for consumer-grade flash memory:

Condition       Expected Retention

[preformatted text]

Brand new, room temp    | 10+ years

After many writes       | 1–3 years (degrades over time)

High-temp storage       | Shortened lifespan

🧠 So... Are the Electrons Moving?

Not really. Once trapped:

- The electrons are localized in quantum wells in the floating gate.

- Their wavefunctions are spread out in a small region (~nanometers),

- But they don’t travel or drift — they’re effectively stationary (within the quantum trap).

They still exist as quantum objects with kinetic energy, but they’re not moving across the chip, nor “orbiting” anything.

🧬 Bonus: Quantum View

From a quantum standpoint:

- Electrons occupy discrete energy levels in the floating gate potential.

- Tunneling back out (loss) is possible, but the probability per unit time is exponentially tiny.

- The system is designed to make the lifetime of the trapped state much longer than the expected usage period.

🧊 In contrast: What if cooled close to 0 K?

- Lower temperatures would make tunneling even less likely.

- But room temperature is already sufficient for years of stability.

- Cooling is not required — flash drives are engineered to be stable at ambient temps.

karbytes:

Can electrons teleport from one location to another even from within the confines of an enclosing barrier?

ChatGPT:

Yes — but not in the science-fiction sense of "teleportation." In quantum mechanics, electrons can appear to “pass through” barriers they classically shouldn’t be able to cross. This is known as quantum tunneling — and it’s very real, very well-understood, and experimentally confirmed.

Let’s break it down in clear terms:

⚛️ What Is Quantum Tunneling?

- Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where a particle has a finite probability of being detected on the other side of a potential energy barrier, even though it doesn't have enough classical energy to climb over it.

This is not teleportation in the sense of instantaneous or distance-defying travel, but it does violate classical intuition.

🔹 Imagine This:

- An electron is trapped in a well (like a valley) with walls on both sides.

- The electron doesn’t have enough energy to climb the walls — classically, it should stay inside forever.

- But quantum mechanically, the electron is described by a wavefunction that “leaks” into the walls and beyond.

- There’s a non-zero probability that the electron will be found outside the well, having "tunneled" through the barrier.

🌀 It didn’t physically drill a hole, climb over, or burst through — its presence just "appears" on the other side based on quantum probabilities.

🚪 Real-World Examples of Tunneling

[preformatted text]

Phenomenon                              | Description

Flash memory (USBs)                     | Electrons tunnel into or out of floating gates to store data.

Nuclear fusion                          | Protons tunnel through electrostatic repulsion to fuse in stars.

Alpha decay                             | Nuclei emit alpha particles via tunneling through the nuclear barrier.

Tunnel diodes                           | Special electronics that exploit tunneling for fast switching.

Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM)    | Detect tunneling electrons to image atoms.

🧪 What Determines the Probability of Tunneling?

- Barrier width: thinner barriers → higher tunneling chance.

- Barrier height: lower energy barriers → higher tunneling chance.

- Electron energy: more energetic electrons → higher tunneling chance.

Mathematically, the tunneling probability TT roughly follows:

T ∝ e ^ (−2 * κ * d) where κ = square_root((2 * m * (V − E)) / ℏ)

d = barrier width

V = barrier height

E = particle energy

m = particle mass

ℏ = reduced Planck constant

🚫 Is This Teleportation?

Not in the Star Trek sense:

✅ The electron moves according to its quantum wavefunction.

❌ It does not vanish in one spot and reappear instantly somewhere else.

✅ But it violates classical confinement — it can exist in places with “forbidden” energy.

That’s why quantum tunneling is sometimes described metaphorically as “quantum teleportation,” but it’s fundamentally just wavefunction evolution under the rules of quantum physics.

🧠 Bonus: Does It Violate Causality?

Nope. Tunneling still respects relativistic causality and local conservation laws — but it plays by the probabilistic rules of quantum theory.

📌 Summary:

Concept                         | Quantum Tunneling

Occurs through barriers?        | ✅ Yes — even with insufficient classical energy

Would you like to see a simple simulation or diagram showing how an electron wavefunction tunnels through a potential barrier?

karbytes:

Does the electron have to be able to have an unobstructed pathway around a barrier in order to move from one side of that barrier to the other side?

ChatGPT:

No — the electron does not need an unobstructed pathway around a barrier to move from one side to the other.

That’s the weird and fascinating nature of quantum tunneling:

- An electron can cross a barrier without physically going around it — even if the barrier completely encloses the region like a sealed box.

Let’s explore why that’s possible.

🔮 Quantum Perspective: It’s About the Wavefunction

In quantum mechanics, an electron is not a little ball that travels in a single trajectory — it’s described by a wavefunction that assigns a probability amplitude to every location in space.

When that wavefunction encounters a barrier (say, a region of high potential energy):

- It doesn’t stop abruptly.

- Instead, it extends into the barrier and decays exponentially inside it.

- If the barrier is thin enough, that wavefunction can "leak through" to the other side.

This allows for a non-zero probability that a measurement will find the electron on the far side, even if it couldn’t classically climb over or go around.

🧱 Think of This Analogy

- Classical world: A marble in a box can’t escape unless there’s a hole.

- Quantum world: An electron “feels” the other side of the wall through its wavefunction. If the wall is thin enough (on the quantum scale), it can be detected outside, even though it didn’t go around or over.

No opening is required. No slits, no tunnels, no gaps — just a thin enough energy barrier, and quantum mechanics takes care of the rest.

🧪 Real Example: Alpha Decay in Nuclei

In radioactive decay:

- An alpha particle is trapped inside a nucleus by a high potential energy wall.

- It tunnels through the nuclear barrier and escapes — even though there's no pathway out in the classical sense.

- This is observed and measured regularly in nuclear physics.

⚠️ So What’s the Limitation?

The barrier must not be infinitely thick or infinitely high.

If the barrier is:

- Too wide → tunneling probability drops exponentially.

- Too high in potential energy → same effect.

But: If the barrier is finite (even completely enclosing the electron), there’s always some tunneling probability, though it might be vanishingly small.

🚫 Important Clarification

✅ Tunneling is a genuine quantum phenomenon — it’s not about finding secret gaps.

❌ It does not mean the electron is "squeezing through" a crack.

✅ The barrier can be solid, continuous, and sealed — and tunneling can still occur.

Quantum Tunneling: Electron Wavefunction Through a Potential Barrier

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_25march2025_p1.png]

Here’s a visual representation of quantum tunneling:

- The blue curve shows the electron’s wavefunction (∣ψ∣∣ψ∣) — notice how it decays inside the red barrier region, yet still extends beyond it.

- The red dashed line and shaded area represent the potential energy barrier — a region the electron shouldn't classically be able to cross.

- Despite the barrier being solid and continuous, the electron's wavefunction leaks through, meaning there's a non-zero chance the electron can be found on the other side.

This is a classic signature of quantum tunneling — no path around the barrier is needed, and yet the electron can still emerge on the far side. Would you like to explore how tunneling probabilities change with barrier height or width?

karbytes:

In order to pass through the wall of a box, does an electron have to turn into pure energy rather than remain as a mass-containing particle?

ChatGPT:

No — an electron does not need to turn into “pure energy” or lose its mass in order to tunnel through a wall or potential barrier.

Let’s break this down clearly:

🧲 Tunneling Doesn’t Require Annihilation

When an electron tunnels through a barrier, it remains an electron:

- It retains its mass, charge, and identity.

- It does not transform into a photon, wave of energy, or any other particle.

- It simply moves from a region where it’s classically allowed to be, through a classically forbidden zone, and into another allowed region — all as a particle governed by quantum mechanics.

🔹 Its wavefunction temporarily has non-zero amplitude inside the barrier, but the electron itself is not “converted” into something else.

⚡ What About Turning Into “Pure Energy”?

The phrase “pure energy” usually refers to massless particles (like photons) or energy liberated during matter-antimatter annihilation.

But:

- An electron doesn’t need to annihilate to move through matter.

- No photon or boson conversion is necessary during tunneling.

- Energy is conserved — and the electron’s total energy remains the same (even though the potential energy in the barrier is higher).

It’s like this:

- The electron “borrows” probability to exist in the classically forbidden zone — but not mass or identity.

This is totally consistent with the uncertainty principle and the nonzero width of quantum particles.

🌀 Is There a Time or Energy Violation?

Sort of — in spirit, not in math.

In quantum tunneling:

- The electron seems to “violate” energy conservation locally, because it’s in a region where its total energy E is less than the potential V.

- But this is not a real violation — it’s a feature of the wavefunction-based model, not a breakdown of physics.

There’s no need to invoke special transformations. Just standard quantum mechanics.

🧠 Analogy: Shadow on a Wall

Think of an electron’s wavefunction like a shadowy blur:

- Even if the wall blocks the main “body,” the blur leaks through.

- If the wall is thin enough, that blur extends to the far side.

- The electron doesn’t change form — it just has a small chance of “showing up” on the other side.

🧬 Quantum Particle Identity Is Preserved

Electrons are fermions with:

- Mass = 9.11 * (10 ^ -31) kg

- Charge = −1e

- Spin = 1/2

None of that changes during tunneling. It’s a quantum leap, not a transformation.
