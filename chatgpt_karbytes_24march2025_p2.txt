Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser (Kim et al. 1999) – Experiment and Results

Experiment Setup (Kim et al., 1999)

In 1999, Yoon-Ho Kim and colleagues performed a “delayed-choice quantum eraser” experiment to test how quantum interference can appear or disappear depending on whether which-path information is retained or “erased.” The setup (schematically illustrated below) involved a double-slit illuminated by an argon laser, producing single photons (351 nm) that pass through either slit A or slit B. After the slits, a nonlinear BBO crystal induces spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), splitting each photon into a pair of entangled photons – one signal photon and one idler photoninterference setup). The idler photon takes a longer path through a system of prisms (PS), beam splitters (BSₐ, BS_b, BS_c), and mirrors (Mₐ, M_b), leading to four possible detectors D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄ on the idler side. Importantly:

D₃ or D₄ (“which-path” detectors): If an idler clicks at D₃, it could only have come from slit B; if it clicks at D₄, it could only have come from slit A. Thus D₃ and D₄ provide which-path information about the signal photon.

D₁ or D₂ (“eraser” detectors): Idlers arriving at D₁ or D₂ have been recombined at BS_c such that their origin is indistinguishable – these detectors erase the which-path information. No single idler at D₁ or D₂ reveals which slit was taken.

The signal detector D₀ is triggered ~8 ns before its entangled idler partner reaches D₁–D₄ (due to shorter path length). A coincidence circuit pairs each D₀ detection with the corresponding idler detection (D₁–D₄). By examining coincident counts (joint detection events), one can post-select subsets of D₀ hits corresponding to a given idler detector. This allows the experimenters to see how the D₀ pattern changes depending on where the idler went, even though D₀ itself, considered alone, shows no clear interference.

Figure 1. Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser Setup (Kim et al. 1999). Simplified diagram of the experiment. A photon passes through a double slit (left), then is split into an entangled signal-idler pair by a BBO crystal. The signal (red or light-blue path) goes to detector D₀. The idler (colored paths going downward) encounters prisms (PS), beam splitters (green) and mirrors (gray), and is ultimately detected at D₁, D₂, D₃ or D₄. Detectors D₃ and D₄ mark the photon’s origin (slit B or A respectively), while D₁ and D₂ erase the which-path information by mixing the paths. A coincidence counter (blue circuits, right) correlates D₀’s signal with each idler detector’s events.

Interference vs. No-Interference in Coincidence Counts

Kim et al. recorded the coincidence count distributions at D₀ conditioned on each idler detector. Strikingly, they found that interference fringes appear or vanish depending on which D detector is heralding the idler:

Interference Patterns (Fringes) – Eraser Conditions: When considering only those D₀ detections whose idler went to D₁ or D₂, an interference pattern emerges in the joint detection rates. In other words, R₀₁ (coincidences D₀&D₁) and R₀₂ (D₀&D₂) each show a wavy, oscillatory distribution as D₀ is scanned. These fringes are analogous to a Young’s double-slit pattern. However, the two patterns are out of phase by π (peaks of R₀₁ align with troughs of R₀₂). This phase shift is due to the differing path lengths/reflections for D₁ vs. D₂ (the beam splitter BS_c causes one subset of coincidences to interfere with a relative phase). Notably, if you sum R₀₁ + R₀₂, the fringes cancel out, yielding a flat distribution. (This combined sum corresponds to ignoring which idler detector clicked – i.e. the total D₀ pattern, which shows no interference, consistent with complementarity.)

No Interference (Clumping) – Which-Path Conditions: In contrast, the subsets of D₀ hits whose idlers went to D₃ or D₄ show no interference pattern. These joint counts – R₀₃ (D₀&D₃) and R₀₄ (D₀&D₄) – exhibit a single broad diffraction envelope (a “blob” distribution) rather than multiple fringes. This is expected because D₃ and D₄ each provide definite which-slit knowledge for every photon, enforcing particle-like behavior with no two-slit interference. In fact, Kim et al. reported “an absence of interference” in R₀₃ (and similarly R₀₄). R₀₃ and R₀₄ were nearly identical apart from a slight shift in the peak position.

Crucially, all four coincidence distributions R₀₁, R₀₂, R₀₃, R₀₄ are recorded simultaneously during one scan of D₀. Only when the data is partitioned by idler outcome do the contrasting patterns emerge – even though every signal photon hit D₀ long before its idler’s detection was registered. This demonstrates the “quantum eraser” idea: whether an interference pattern is present in the signal depends on how the entangled idler is measured later. Yet no information or causation actually travels backward in time; the interference is only visible in the subset selection (after correlating with D₁/D₂), and the total D₀ counts (all idlers combined) show no interference at all.

Figure 2. Joint-Detection Result – No Interference vs Interference. Example of a coincidence count distribution from Kim et al.’s experiment. Shown here is the R₀₄ subset (signal coincidences when the idler went to D₄), displaying a single broad peak – i.e. no interference fringes. In the actual data, the R₀₁ and R₀₂ subsets each showed interference fringes (peaks and troughs) which were phase-shifted relative to each other. By contrast, R₀₃ and R₀₄ yielded only a smooth diffraction profile. (R₀₄ was not explicitly plotted in the original paper; it is assumed to mirror R₀₃.)
