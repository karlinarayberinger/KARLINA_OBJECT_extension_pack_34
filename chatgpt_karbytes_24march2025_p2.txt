karbytes:

Provide at least one image depicting the result of that experiment. [Deep research]

ChatGPT:

Just to clarify—are you looking for an original or authentic image from the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment (e.g. the actual interference patterns from the paper), or would you also be interested in clear diagrams or reconstructions based on that experiment to help visualize the results?

karbytes:

Both please.

ChatGPT:

Great, I’ll find both an original image or plot from the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment by Kim et al., as well as clear diagrams or reconstructions that illustrate the experiment's results—especially the interference and non-interference patterns seen in the signal photon coincidences. I’ll let you know as soon as I have them.
