karbytes:

Provide at least one image depicting the result of that experiment. [Deep research]

ChatGPT:

Just to clarify—are you looking for an original or authentic image from the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment (e.g. the actual interference patterns from the paper), or would you also be interested in clear diagrams or reconstructions based on that experiment to help visualize the results?

karbytes:

Both please.

ChatGPT:

Great, I’ll find both an original image or plot from the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment by Kim et al., as well as clear diagrams or reconstructions that illustrate the experiment's results—especially the interference and non-interference patterns seen in the signal photon coincidences. I’ll let you know as soon as I have them.

[Images and Diagrams of 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Results]

- I'm gathering images and diagrams from the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment by Yoon-Ho Kim et al., including interference patterns and non-interference patterns.

[Searched for Yoon-Ho Kim quantum eraser images]

- I’m thinking about the sources of interference and non-interference patterns in the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, including original and modern diagrams, and their clarity for visual data interpretation.

- I’m considering opening the PDF with browser.open to view the figures and more content directly.

[Read ar5iv.org]

- I'm analyzing interference patterns and detection rates. Comparing Figs 3 and 4 for phase shifts, Fig 5 shows no interference. Proposing images for clarity.

- I’m looking into accessing a PDF via Python or finding images, and also checking out a Wikipedia page and a Reddit discussion for diagrams or explanations.

- Interpreting phenomenon at detectors: detecting interference and diffraction patterns based on idler detection locations.

[Read researchgate.net]

- I’m mapping out how to access PRL, must check subscription status. Considering Wikipedia and Reddit for potential images or links.

[Read en.wikipedia.org]

- I'm thinking about external links or images online. Maybe Google images or specific search engines would work.

[Searched for R01 and R02 interference patterns]

- I'm piecing together resources like Hackaday articles and cs.uwaterloo PPTs. They might offer images or detailed descriptions, useful for understanding interference patterns in waveforms.

[Read hackaday.com]

- I found that Hackaday might contain images showing interference patterns specifically labeled "er_08" linked to waveforms R01 and R02.

[Read more from hackaday.com]

- Noticing references to "R0n" diagrams and "er_08" imagery, likely illustrating particle and interference patterns, from a hackaday source.

[Read more from hackaday.com]

- I'm looking at a small image preview possibly related to simulations or representations. Considering Hackaday's content, it might involve waveforms from varied sources.

[Read more from hackaday.com]

- I’m working through whether "the top image" refers to an earlier image in the article or one from Hackaday. Planning to investigate any images present.

[Read more from hackaday.com]

- I’m gathering info on various images from Hackaday, including diagrams and interference patterns, to piece together their relevance to the quantum eraser experiment.

[Searched for Kim Scully 1999 quantum eraser graph]

- I'm digging into the search results to understand key concepts and potential figures in "Taming the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser" on PhilSci-Archive.

[Read philsci-archive.pitt.edu]

- I’m analyzing Figure 2's data patterns at D0 and D1-D4, examining interference fringes and clump patterns, and noting potential conceptual content.

[Searched for R03 and R04 interference]

- I'm gathering info on various platforms like Reddit, physics.stackexchange, and arXiv. The snippet suggests R03 and R04 are similarly shaped but shifted.

[Searched for R01 R02 quantum eraser graph]

- I'm pulling together different data types like graphs and Bayesian statistical analysis to streamline the selection of a suitable distribution for modeling a particular variable.

[Read commons.wikimedia.org]

- I’m curious about the file linked to the date/time text, which might be an SVG. I’ll consider fetching a PNG or checking if the image can be displayed in the browser.

[Read upload.wikimedia.org]

- It's interesting to see that embedding SVG files directly might not support them. I'm looking for raster versions or PNG previews on Wikimedia Commons, considering links and dimensions to find a feasible solution.

[Read more from upload.wikimedia.org]

- I'm thinking about converting the SVG to PNG or finding it directly on Google Images. Checking for relevant titles might also help.

[Read commons.wikimedia.org]

- I'm examining if "KimDelayedChoiceQuantumEraserGraphsSVG.svg" is a duplicate of "Delayed_Choice_Quantum_Eraser_Graphs.svg." Both files likely illustrate similar concepts.

[Read upload.wikimedia.org]

- I'm exploring multiple ways to resolve image processing issues, including server restrictions and offline problems. Adjusting the image resolution might also help in mitigating the glitch.
