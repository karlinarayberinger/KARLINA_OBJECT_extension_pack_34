Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser (Kim et al. 1999) – Experiment and Results

Experiment Setup (Kim et al., 1999)

In 1999, Yoon-Ho Kim and colleagues performed a “delayed-choice quantum eraser” experiment to test how quantum interference can appear or disappear depending on whether which-path information is retained or “erased.” The setup (schematically illustrated below) involved a double-slit illuminated by an argon laser, producing single photons (351 nm) that pass through either slit A or slit B. After the slits, a nonlinear BBO crystal induces spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), splitting each photon into a pair of entangled photons – one signal photon and one idler photoninterference setup). The idler photon takes a longer path through a system of prisms (PS), beam splitters (BSₐ, BS_b, BS_c), and mirrors (Mₐ, M_b), leading to four possible detectors D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄ on the idler side. Importantly:

D₃ or D₄ (“which-path” detectors): If an idler clicks at D₃, it could only have come from slit B; if it clicks at D₄, it could only have come from slit A. Thus D₃ and D₄ provide which-path information about the signal photon.

D₁ or D₂ (“eraser” detectors): Idlers arriving at D₁ or D₂ have been recombined at BS_c such that their origin is indistinguishable – these detectors erase the which-path information. No single idler at D₁ or D₂ reveals which slit was taken.

The signal detector D₀ is triggered ~8 ns before its entangled idler partner reaches D₁–D₄ (due to shorter path length). A coincidence circuit pairs each D₀ detection with the corresponding idler detection (D₁–D₄). By examining coincident counts (joint detection events), one can post-select subsets of D₀ hits corresponding to a given idler detector. This allows the experimenters to see how the D₀ pattern changes depending on where the idler went, even though D₀ itself, considered alone, shows no clear interference.

Figure 1. Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser Setup (Kim et al. 1999). Simplified diagram of the experiment. A photon passes through a double slit (left), then is split into an entangled signal-idler pair by a BBO crystal. The signal (red or light-blue path) goes to detector D₀. The idler (colored paths going downward) encounters prisms (PS), beam splitters (green) and mirrors (gray), and is ultimately detected at D₁, D₂, D₃ or D₄. Detectors D₃ and D₄ mark the photon’s origin (slit B or A respectively), while D₁ and D₂ erase the which-path information by mixing the paths. A coincidence counter (blue circuits, right) correlates D₀’s signal with each idler detector’s events.

Interference vs. No-Interference in Coincidence Counts

Kim et al. recorded the coincidence count distributions at D₀ conditioned on each idler detector. Strikingly, they found that interference fringes appear or vanish depending on which D detector is heralding the idler:

Interference Patterns (Fringes) – Eraser Conditions: When considering only those D₀ detections whose idler went to D₁ or D₂, an interference pattern emerges in the joint detection rates. In other words, R₀₁ (coincidences D₀&D₁) and R₀₂ (D₀&D₂) each show a wavy, oscillatory distribution as D₀ is scanned. These fringes are analogous to a Young’s double-slit pattern. However, the two patterns are out of phase by π (peaks of R₀₁ align with troughs of R₀₂). This phase shift is due to the differing path lengths/reflections for D₁ vs. D₂ (the beam splitter BS_c causes one subset of coincidences to interfere with a relative phase). Notably, if you sum R₀₁ + R₀₂, the fringes cancel out, yielding a flat distribution. (This combined sum corresponds to ignoring which idler detector clicked – i.e. the total D₀ pattern, which shows no interference, consistent with complementarity.)

No Interference (Clumping) – Which-Path Conditions: In contrast, the subsets of D₀ hits whose idlers went to D₃ or D₄ show no interference pattern. These joint counts – R₀₃ (D₀&D₃) and R₀₄ (D₀&D₄) – exhibit a single broad diffraction envelope (a “blob” distribution) rather than multiple fringes. This is expected because D₃ and D₄ each provide definite which-slit knowledge for every photon, enforcing particle-like behavior with no two-slit interference. In fact, Kim et al. reported “an absence of interference” in R₀₃ (and similarly R₀₄). R₀₃ and R₀₄ were nearly identical apart from a slight shift in the peak position.

Crucially, all four coincidence distributions R₀₁, R₀₂, R₀₃, R₀₄ are recorded simultaneously during one scan of D₀. Only when the data is partitioned by idler outcome do the contrasting patterns emerge – even though every signal photon hit D₀ long before its idler’s detection was registered. This demonstrates the “quantum eraser” idea: whether an interference pattern is present in the signal depends on how the entangled idler is measured later. Yet no information or causation actually travels backward in time; the interference is only visible in the subset selection (after correlating with D₁/D₂), and the total D₀ counts (all idlers combined) show no interference at all.

Figure 2. Joint-Detection Result – No Interference vs Interference. Example of a coincidence count distribution from Kim et al.’s experiment. Shown here is the R₀₄ subset (signal coincidences when the idler went to D₄), displaying a single broad peak – i.e. no interference fringes. In the actual data, the R₀₁ and R₀₂ subsets each showed interference fringes (peaks and troughs) which were phase-shifted relative to each other. By contrast, R₀₃ and R₀₄ yielded only a smooth diffraction profile. (R₀₄ was not explicitly plotted in the original paper; it is assumed to mirror R₀₃.)

Published Figures and Follow-ups

Kim et al.’s original Phys. Rev. Lett. (2000) article included graphs of the coincidence rates: interference fringes for R₀₁ and R₀₂ (Fig. 3 and 4) and a flat distribution for R₀₃ (Fig. 5). The key findings are often depicted in summaries and textbooks. For example, the Wikimedia Commons graphic based on Kim’s data explicitly labels the fringe patterns (R₀₁, R₀₂) versus the “clump” patterns (R₀₃, R₀₄). Many reproductions illustrate that R₀₁ and R₀₂ are complementary interference patterns whose sum recreates the single broad curve of R₀₃/R₀₄. In essence, the interference is there in the conditional data, but hidden in the aggregate. Modern discussions (and even classroom demonstrations) emphasize that selecting subsets by the idler detector is like “filtering” the D₀ hits to reveal interference that is otherwise washed out.

Several follow-up studies and explanations have included helpful diagrams of this effect. One visual approach is to color-code the signal hits by the corresponding idler detector. If one plots D₀’s hits tagged by D₁ (say, red) versus those tagged by D₂ (blue), each forms a fringe pattern shifted relative to the other; but when overlaid they sum to a uniform distribution. Conversely, hits tagged by D₃ or D₄ each just form a single hump (no fringes). This reinforces the idea that interference appears only when which-path information is truly unavailable – even though the “choice” to erase or not erase is made after the signal has hit D₀. The Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment thus elegantly demonstrates how entanglement and measurement selection can recover interference from an entangled particle without violating causality.

karbytes:

In a different conversation you explained how photons can be made to travel significantly slower than the speed of light. Can the speed of electrons also be manipulated in a laboratory?

ChatGPT:

Yes, absolutely — the speed of electrons can be and routinely is manipulated in laboratory settings. In fact, electron velocity control is central to fields like electron microscopy, particle accelerators, semiconductor physics, and quantum optics.

Let’s walk through some core ideas:

🔋 1. Electron Speed Depends on Energy

Unlike photons (which always move at the speed of light in vacuum), electrons have mass, so their speed depends on their kinetic energy.

In the lab, we usually control an electron’s speed by applying an electric potential (voltage):

The electron gains kinetic energy E_k = q * V, where:

q = charge of the electron (~1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C),

V = voltage.

The classical speed (non-relativistic) is:
    
v = square_root((2 * q * V) / m_e)

where m_e is the electron’s mass (~9.11×10⁻³¹ kg).

For example:

1 electron-volt → ~593 km/s

10 keV → ~59,300 km/s

1 MeV → ~94% of light speed (requires relativity)

⚙️ 2. Practical Ways to Slow or Control Electrons

🧲 Electric & Magnetic Fields

- Electrons can be accelerated or decelerated using fields in cathode ray tubes, electron beams, linear accelerators, and RF cavities.

- Magnetic fields don’t change speed directly (they deflect direction), but magnetic lenses are used in electron microscopes to focus and guide electrons.

🧊 Cryogenic Semiconductors

- In semiconductors (especially at cryogenic temperatures), electron drift velocity is reduced due to reduced kinetic energy and lattice interactions.

- Electrons can be trapped or guided through quantum dots, quantum wells, and 2D materials at controlled speeds.

🧬 Cold Electron Sources

- Techniques like photoemission from cooled cathodes produce electrons with very low thermal energy → slower starting speeds.

- Useful in ultrafast electron diffraction and quantum optics.

🌪 Slowing via Matter Waves

- In electron interferometry, electrons are guided slowly enough to exhibit clear wave-like behavior over large scales (think: de Broglie wavelength increases as velocity decreases).

🧪 Advanced: Ultra-Slow Electron Experiments

There are even niche setups (e.g. Rydberg atoms or Penning traps) where electrons are almost motionless, orbiting at large distances or held in magnetic/ionic cages.

- Penning traps: electrons (or ions) are held in place and manipulated using combined static magnetic and electric fields.

- Motional ground state: used in quantum computing with trapped ions or electrons.

How fast do electrons typically orbit the nucleus of an atom?

ChatGPT:

Great question — and the answer gets deep fast! Let’s explore it from both classical and quantum standpoints, since atomic electrons don’t really “orbit” like planets — but we can still estimate their typical speeds in various atoms.

🧮 In the Bohr Model (Hydrogen-like atoms)

In the early Bohr model, electrons are treated as orbiting the nucleus in circular orbits. While not fully quantum accurate, it gives surprisingly good estimates for hydrogen-like atoms (one electron, like H, He⁺, Li²⁺).

For hydrogen (n = 1 energy level), the electron speed is:

v = (Z ⋅ α ⋅ c) / n

Where:

Z = atomic number (1 for hydrogen),

α = fine-structure constant ≈ 1/137,

c = speed of light ≈ 3.00 × (10 ^ 8) m/s,

n = principal quantum number.

🔢 So for hydrogen in the ground state (n=1):

v ≈ (1 / 137) * (3.00 * (10 ^ 8)) ≈ 2.19 * (10 ^ 6) m/s

That’s roughly 2.2 million meters per second, or about 0.0073c (less than 1% the speed of light).

🔬 In Real Quantum Mechanics

In modern quantum theory, electrons exist as probability clouds — they don’t have fixed orbits, but we can still talk about average kinetic energy and thus typical speed.

For the hydrogen ground state wavefunction:

Average kinetic energy ⟨K⟩ = 13.6 / 2 = 6.8 eV.

From this, we estimate:

(1 / 2) * (m * (v ^ 2)) = 6.8 eV ⇒ v ≈ 2.19 * (10 ^ 6) m/s

So quantum mechanics agrees numerically with Bohr — but interprets things differently.

🧨 For Heavier Atoms (Relativistic Speeds!)

For high-Z elements like uranium (Z = 92), inner-shell (1s) electrons move much faster:

v ≈ (Z ⋅ α ⋅ c) / n ⇒ v ≈ (92 / 137) ⋅ c ≈ 0.67 c

That’s 67% the speed of light — so relativistic corrections are required for accuracy in heavy atoms. This speed increase also affects chemistry (e.g., the color of gold and the liquid nature of mercury at room temperature come from relativistic effects on their electrons).

⚡ Summary Table

[preformatted text]

Atom            | Z       Approx. Electron Speed (1s orbital)

Hydrogen        | 1       ~2.2 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.0073c)

Carbon          | 6       ~13 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.043c)

Iron            | 26      ~57 × 10⁶ m/s (~0.19c)

Uranium         | 92      ~2.0 × 10⁸ m/s (~0.67c)

Would you like a visual of these “electron cloud speeds” or a simulation of relativistic vs non-relativistic effects in orbitals?

karbytes:

Do electrons typically travel around the nucleus of an atom in a random manner?

ChatGPT:

That’s an insightful question — and the answer gets to the heart of quantum mechanics and how we think about electrons in atoms.

The short version is:

- Electrons don’t “travel around” the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.
    
- Instead, they exist as quantum probability clouds — and their position and momentum are not simultaneously well-defined.

Let’s break it down:

🔮 1. No Classical Trajectories in Quantum Mechanics

In the classical picture, one might imagine an electron as a tiny ball zipping in circles around the nucleus. That’s intuitive, but not accurate in the quantum world.

In quantum mechanics:

- Electrons are described by wavefunctions (solutions to the Schrödinger equation).

- The square of the wavefunction gives the probability density — i.e., where you're likely to find the electron upon measurement.

- Between measurements, we don't say the electron "is" at a specific point — it’s delocalized.

So: electrons don’t follow a path like an orbit; instead, they form standing wave patterns around the nucleus.

☁️ 2. Atomic Orbitals Are Not Orbits

What we call “orbitals” (1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) are probability distributions.

- A 1s orbital (hydrogen’s ground state) is a spherical cloud — the electron is equally likely to be found in any direction at a given distance from the nucleus.

- A 2p orbital is dumbbell-shaped — showing regions where the electron is more likely to be detected.

- These shapes are fixed by quantum numbers and remain stationary over time unless disturbed.

So rather than moving randomly around the nucleus, the electron exists in a kind of fuzzy, standing wave that defines regions where it’s more or less likely to appear.

🌀 3. Motion Still Exists — But It’s Not Random "Traveling"

Even though electrons don't orbit in the classical sense, they still have kinetic energy and non-zero momentum — especially in excited states.

- Their motion is quantum-mechanical, meaning we can't assign them a definite trajectory.

- In time-dependent interpretations (or under perturbations), the probability cloud can shift, or electron density can “slosh” — but not in a random bouncing-ball way.

🧠 So What Is “Random” About It?

The position where you detect an electron is fundamentally probabilistic:

- You can’t predict exactly where it will be.

- But you can know the probability distribution.

- Over many measurements, the detections will match the orbital shape.

So the randomness is in the outcome of position measurements, not in some erratic motion.

Are electrons or photons ever motionless (i.e. traveling at zero velocity)?

ChatGPT:

Excellent question — and it cuts to the core of how we define motion, energy, and observables in quantum physics.

Let’s tackle photons and electrons separately, since their physical properties and constraints are quite different.

⚛️ PHOTONS: Are Never Motionless

Photons are massless particles, and in physics, massless particles must always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum:

v_photon = c = 299,792,458 m/s

So:

❌ Photons can never be at rest.

❌ There is no reference frame in which a photon is stationary.

✅ They can be slowed down in media (e.g., glass, Bose-Einstein condensates), but this is due to interactions — their fundamental speed remains c between interactions.

🧲 ELECTRONS: Can Be Motionless (in principle)

Electrons have mass, so they can be at rest relative to some reference frame — though this comes with quantum caveats.

🔹 In Classical Physics:

- Yes — an electron at rest has zero velocity and rest energy E=mc2E=mc2.

- You can hold an electron still in, say, an electric trap or vacuum chamber.

🔹 In Quantum Mechanics:

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies:

Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ℏ2

So: if an electron has exactly zero momentum (i.e., is truly motionless), then its position is infinitely uncertain (i.e., it could be anywhere in the universe).

➤ This makes a perfectly motionless electron unphysical.

🔹 But… electrons can be very nearly at rest:

- In Penning or Paul traps, electrons can be confined and cooled to have extremely low kinetic energy.

- In solid-state systems, such as quantum dots, electrons can be trapped in effectively motionless states.

- In Bose-Einstein condensates, electrons within atoms can have very low momenta.

So:

✅ Yes, electrons can be motionless (or nearly so) in a given frame.

But: their wavefunction spreads out, so “motionless” doesn't mean “stuck at a point.”

🧊 Real-World Example: Electrons in a Trap

In a Penning trap (combining electric and magnetic fields):

- Electrons can be cooled to microkelvin temperatures.

- Their thermal motion is drastically reduced.

- They can remain nearly stationary for seconds or more.

particles       | Can Be at Rest?       | Why / Why Not

Photons         | ❌                    | Never Massless ⇒ must travel at c

Electron        | ✅ Sometimes          | Has mass ⇒ can be slowed, but quantum limits apply
