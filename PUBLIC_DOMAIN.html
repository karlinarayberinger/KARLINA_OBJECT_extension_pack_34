<p><strong>HYPERLINK_COLORING_CONVENTIONS</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The following specifications pertain to each hyperlink which is displayed on any web page of the website:</p>
<p>Each of the hyperlinks which is displayed on this website has a background color or a text color which is either <strong>black</strong> (i.e. #000000), <strong>green</strong> (i.e. #00ff00), or <strong>orange</strong> (i.e. #ff9000).</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#ff9000">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is orange and whose text color is black refers to a file which belongs to a website which karbytes did not create and which is hosted on the public World Wide Web.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#00ff00">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is green and whose text color is black refers to a public GitHub repository which karbytes created or to a GitHub account which karbytes created.</p>
<p>A hyperlink whose background color is black refers to a raw source code file or a raw media file which is hosted on a public karbytes-created GitHub repository (and the web page for each of such raw files displays exactly one source code or media file without any extraneous content such as hyperlinks or menu buttons).</p>
<p>An example of a <strong>source code</strong> file which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/fibonacci_numbers.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fibonacci.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a <strong>media file</strong> which karbytes created and uploaded to GitHub is the file named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/cube_comprised_of_eight_equally_sized_cubes_03_may_2023.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cube_comprised_of_eight_equally_sized_cubes_03_may_2023.jpeg</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is black and whose text color is green refers to (a) a source code file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more code-dominant than prose-dominant.</p>
<p>A <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000">hyperlink</strong> whose background color is black and whose text color is orange refers to (a) a media file which karbytes is the creator of or else (b) to a web page of a WordPress website which karbytes is the creator of and such that the referenced web page is considered by karbytes to be more prose-dominant than code-dominant.</p>

<p><strong>ASSUMPTIONS</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The entity (or entities) which create(s) a particular piece of intellectual property is (or are) implicitly, automatically, and immediately assigned sole ownership of that piece of intellectual property as soon as that piece of intellectual property is created.</p>
<p>After a piece of intellectual property is created, the creator (and, hence, the original owner) of that piece of intellectual property can assign a particular <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license</a> to that piece of intellectual property which specifies how the creator of that intellectual property wants other people to use that intellectual property. For instance, the original owner of a piece of intellectual property (or legal heir of such intellectual property) might license that piece of intellectual property as being illegal to access without first purchasing an access code to view or download that intellectual property.</p>
<p>In addition to assuming that the original creators of a piece of intellectual property are initially the sole proprietors of that piece of intellectual property, that piece of intellectual property is also assumed to initially be private instead of public. Intellectual property which is private instead of part of the public domain is illegal to share without that intellectual property owner&#8217;s explicit permission for each instance of enabling some entity other than the owner of that intellectual property access to that intellectual property. By contrast, intellectual property which is part of the public domain is legal for any entity to access and to claim ownership of (but <u>claiming ownership of a piece of intellectual property which is copied wholly or partially from some piece of intellectual property which was licensed as public domain or as open source does not automatically make that copy also public domain</u> (but the copy may be assigned more exclusive access conditions which may or may not be physically enforceable)).</p>

// The following pseudocode elaborates on what was discussed in the previous three paragraphs.

Let time_0 be a point in time which occurs before the point in time named time_1.

Let time_1 be a point in time which occurs before the point in time named time_2.

Let person_A and person_B each be unique end users of the same digital content distribution network.

Let ip_X and ip_Y each be unique instances of intellectual property which can be verbatim encoded as a uniquely-corresponding finite sequence of binary digits within the context of a network comprised of digital computers which person_A and person_B use to distribute and access digital files.

Suppose person_A creates a piece of intellectual property named ip_X at time_0.

Then, at time_0, ip_X is privately owned exclusively by person_A.

At time_0 and before time_1, it is illegal for person_B to own a copy of ip_X.

Then, at time_1, person_A assigns the license of public_domain to ip_X.

At time_1, it is legal for person_B to own a copy of ip_X.

Then, at time_2, person_B makes a copy of ip_X and names that copy ip_Y.

At time_2, it is illegal for person_A to own a copy of ip_Y but it is not illegal for person_A to own a copy of ip_X.
