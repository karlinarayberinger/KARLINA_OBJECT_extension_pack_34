<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>nature</strong> (i.e. the whole of reality (i.e. all that exists)) as being the only set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, changeless, irreducible, and featureless substrate which permeates and encompasses all phenomena.</p>
<p>According to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a> (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that the entirety of nature is contained inside of one ubiquitous mind), pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (which implies that nature is fundamentally sentient and that consciousness (i.e. awareness (i.e. sentience)) is not an emergent property of sufficiently complex physical structures, but instead, the fundamental substrate which encompasses and which constitutes all physical structures).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is a light sensor inside of an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic</a> circuit detecting incoming <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light</a> whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers.</p>
<p>A <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> nervous system which perceives incoming light (which enters the eyes and which causes a corresponding electrical signal to be sent across the optical nerves and to the visual processing circuits of the brain) whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers does not consciously register that the incoming light has a wavelength of exactly 700 nanometers. Instead, what that human nervous system immediately consciously experiences is the qualitative experience referred to as the color red.</p>
<p>The <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the color red is distinct from the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the number 700.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which detects the presence of or the absence of a particular phenomenon.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a single frame of reference is a &#8220;timeless&#8221; slice of exactly one space-time continuum (or, if that space-time continuum slice does not literally have a temporal <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">length</a> of zero, that slice is occurring in as small of a unit of time as can be measured by the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which renders that slice&#8217;s encompassing spacetime continuum (if and only if that frame of reference is not a snapshot which encompasses all of nature)).</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a single space-time continuum is necessarily rendered by exactly one information processing agent and that space-time continuum is defined as being exactly one universe according to the web page of this website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a>.</p>
<p>A partial rather than <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> frame of reference experiences the passage of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> as progressing in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly one direction</a> (from <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past</a> to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future</a> while that partial frame of reference functions as a barrier between what that frame of reference perceives to be the past and what that frame of reference perceives to be the future while that partial frame of reference appears to itself to always be dwelling in the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">present</a>) and such that a relatively fixed rate of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatially</a> finite frames per <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a> are rendered by that partial frame of reference.</p>
<p>An omniscient rather than partial frame of reference would simultaneously render all partial frames of reference from a perspective which transcends all space-time continuums.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).</p>
<p>Suppose that two unique and partial frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon.</p>
