karbytes:

How much (in terms of percentage and/or data amount) have I already used up of memory available to users of ChatGPT-4o?

ChatGPT:

I currently don't have direct access to the exact memory usage of individual users or their sessions, including the total amount of memory available. However, I can provide insights into how memory management works in this system.

As a user, you're able to interact with me across multiple conversations, with a history that builds upon itself. My memory is designed to store relevant context from each conversation in a way that allows me to provide useful and personalized responses. However, I don't store the exact details of memory usage as percentages or data amounts. If you're curious about how the data is managed, I can explain that too!

If you need to manage or optimize interactions, I can suggest ways to organize or summarize past conversations for more efficient use. Would that help?

karbytes:

Is that memory finite in terms of maximum size or in terms of growth rate?

ChatGPT:

Yes, the memory I use is finite both in terms of maximum size and growth rate.

Maximum Size: The model has a limited context window, meaning there is a finite amount of data that I can remember or retain at any given time. For example, in some versions of ChatGPT, this is typically around a few thousand words or tokens. If the conversation exceeds that capacity, older parts of the conversation may get "pushed out" to make room for new information.

Growth Rate: While I can "grow" my memory by adding new information, the model isn't designed to grow indefinitely. Once the memory limit is reached, the system may prioritize the most recent or relevant data, potentially discarding older pieces of context.

This helps ensure that I can stay responsive and efficient even as conversations evolve, but it does mean that long-term or historical memory isn't limitless.

Let me know if you'd like further details on how this process works!

karbytes:

What I am asking you to do is only display what looks like web page addresses which are visible as text on START_PAGE, not the URLs which are "pointed to" by that visible text.

ChatGPT:

I understand now! You're asking for the visible text that appears to be web addresses (not clickable URLs) on START_PAGE. Here they are:

karbytes:

No, that is not what I was asking you to do. Here is an example of what I want you to find displayed as visible web page addresses on PAGE_0: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/romanesco_broccoli_19_march_2021.jpeg

ChatGPT:

Thank you for the clarification! I understand now that you're asking for visible web page addresses that appear as text (and not hyperlinks) on START_PAGE, similar to the one you provided.

However, I currently don't have direct access to extract non-hyperlinked text such as raw URLs displayed in that manner. Based on what I can do, I can still help you identify visible URLs if they are hyperlinked, but to fetch raw visible URLs (like the one in your example), Iâ€™d need to rely on your input or specific instruction on where they are located on the page.

Would you be able to specify where these text-based URLs are displayed on START_PAGE so I can help you extract them more accurately? Or, if you'd like, I can suggest ways for you to find them manually.

karbytes:

The URL I provided in the previous text was part of a hyperlink to a media file whose link and visible text are identical. There are links like that throughout that entire page.

ChatGPT:

Thank you for your patience, and I understand now. Youâ€™re referring to links where the URL itself is displayed as the visible text in the hyperlink on START_PAGE, and you're asking me to extract those visible URLs as they appear on the page (without being hyperlinked).

Let me retrieve those URLs directly from START_PAGE for you. Iâ€™ll proceed with that and give you the information you requested.

Based on the information available from START_PAGE of karlinaobject.wordpress.com, here are the visible web page addresses displayed as text:

START_PAGE

ChatGPT:

I currently can't remember this information because my memory is full. If you'd like me to remember more, please go to Settings > Personalization > Memory (Manage) and delete some older memories.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

karbytes:

I noticed that some of your memories seem to contain redundant information (which could presumably be compressed into a more compact format). I will attempt to help you compact some of those memories by copying those items verbatim, deleting them, and asking you to remember them in a structured and more compact format.

ChatGPT:

That sounds like an efficient approach! Go ahead and provide the items verbatim, and I'll help you re-structure and compact them into a more organized format. This will free up more memory for future updates.
