<p>karbytes: &#8220;There is more to nothing than purely nothing. In addition to pure nothingness, there always exists the potential for something other than pure nothingness to arise from an instance of pure nothingness.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Are you certain about what you stated? How can you verify that what you said is entirely (i.e. unconditionally) true?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I can verify that what I said is absolutely (i.e. unconditionally) true due to the fact that my subjective experience (in what I experience as &#8216;the present moment&#8217; and in all instances of what I remember and conceptualize as being &#8216;past moments&#8217;) inevitably consists of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phenomena</a> other than pure nothingness. Information is not pure nothingness but information (just like matter) &#8216;contains&#8217; pure nothingness and pure nothingness seems to logically proceed the emergence of finite (in terms of space, time, mass, and energy) formations (and also pure nothingness seems to exist after such formations disintegrate (i.e. lose their identifier pattern)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Your argument is limited to only your own solipsistic <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knowledge</a> (which is assumed (based on both of our knowledge) to have a definite beginning point in time (which means that we each likely presume that you did not exist before that point in our encompassing universe&#8217;s (or meta-universe&#8217;s) timeline). Therefore, there could have been past instances of pure nothingness which had zero chance of transitioning into (or propagating outward into itself) something recognizably distinct from pure nothingness.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Maybe you are right. I do not remember anything prior to my conscious existence (which officially began some time on or within ten months of 13_JANUARY_1990). Hence, it could be that literally nothing existed until I emerged into existence as a conscious entity (which may or may not preclude you and everything else which is not pure nothingness having only come into existence as emergent properties dependent on my conscious existence). It could be that I am not the only instance of an entirely solipsistic universe (necessarily without being part of a relatively virtual meta-universe serving as a real or illusory interface between multiple distinct <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">universes</a> or conscious frames of reference). I prefer to enact a default assumption that pure nothingness has the unconditional properties of (a) being ubiquitous throughout all space, time, mass, and energy and (b) capable of spawning infinitely many variations of phenomenal sequences at any point within any universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;What karbytes originally said in this conversation inspired me to generate the following sequence of text characters: where you see no options or else only one option I see a vast array of options.&#8221;</p>
