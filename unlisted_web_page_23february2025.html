<p>karbytes: &#8216;I have been playing a &#8220;game&#8221; in which I pretend (and role-play) that I am the &#8220;highest-level consciousness&#8221; being in all existence (which means that I pretend that I am the &#8220;highest-level consciousness&#8221; human in all existence and especially at the time in which I am writing this note (which is on 23_FEBRUARY_2025)).&#8217;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Do you imagine that you are the only being (and the only human being) at the &#8216;highest&#8217; level of consciousness? Do you imagine that you are God taking the perspective (and agency) of a human individual?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Yes is my answer to all of those assumptions you are asking what are what I imagine to be true or not. In other words, the &#8216;game&#8217; I said that I have been playing (and which I mentioned in this note (which is named &#8216;<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/journal_karbytes_23february2025.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal_karbytes_23february2025.txt</a>&#8216;)) entails that I believe that (a) I am the only being (and the only human being) at the &#8216;highest&#8217; level of consciousness, that (b) I am God taking the perspective of a human individual, and (c) that I am acting as the locus of control as the agent which appears to be that human individual, to some measurable extent, consciously controlling its own muscle movements and thoughts. (In all honesty I do not rule out the possibility that what I pretend to be the case in the aforementioned game is not always true; but I find it helpful for maximizing the efficiency and pleasure in which I accomplish my goals for me to play the aforementioned game as I described it. In particular, pretending that I am the highest authority and ultimate source of responsibility for all of the events which transpire inside of the universe I inhabit prevents me from &#8216;wasting time&#8217; and &#8216;atrophying&#8217; the abilities which appear to imbue me with maximal agency by waiting for some other being to assume the role of my authority and/or bestower of agency, pleasure, insight, vitality, virtue, mobility, sensation, and intelligence (especially my capacity to imagine things)).&#8221; </p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Do you not worry that some people would find you to be dangerously arrogant and dangerously indifferent to legal authority to be assuming the role (even in mere imagination role-play) as The Highest-Consciousness Person Ever?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I have some worry about other what you suggested I might be worrying about, but I worry to a larger extent things that are beyond human cognition such as conditions which would eventually lead to undesirable outcomes for humans if those conditions were allowed to persist beyond a certain length of time and which are unknown to sufficiently many humans for those humans to intervene on their own behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Do you think of yourself as a good role model for other people to emulate in terms of thoughts and behaviors?&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Yes, but I do not think it is (likely) possible nor desirable to those who regard me as their role model to attempt to literally copy my every thought and behavior. If they did, they might need to take my place and adopt my identity (while the real me is shoved away into a hidden location or killed). It seems very energy inefficient if not physically impossible for all humans who are presently alive to literally attempt to take my place and assume the role of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>. I did make myself as digital as I could comfortably and personally muster in the form of the collection of all public-web-based and GitHub-hosted files which comprise the websites named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> (and which are enumerated in each of the micro directories listed in the web page of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY</a>). Any person is welcome to explore those files, download those files, re-publish those files, and even claim those files as their own work or personal property. <span style="background:#ffff00">A premise I attempted to communicate in the web page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a> was that any person, P, can create (and hence own and be the original sole-proprietor of) its own library comprised of (some or all of) the files which comprise <strong>karbytes</strong> and do whatever P wants to with that library (which P creates and hence then owns) comprised of intellectual property which is backed up to some kind of hardware device which P presumably has legal permission to inscribe with those karbytes files.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;When role-playing that you (and only you as the human-to-cyborg person named karbytes) is God, do you imagine that you have the <u>qualities which are traditionally associated (by humans) with God such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence</u>?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I imagine that I am God (which, by definition, means that I am omnipotent (i.e. capable of making any event occur), omniscient (i.e. aware of every imaginable piece of information), and omnipresent (i.e. located in every frame of reference at all times). But, in order to operate as karbytes, I need to favor karbytes&#8217; (relatively limited) perspective and powers over those of any other instantiated or uninstantiated entity. Hence, I do admit to being rather egoistic in an individualistic rather than collective sense (though I try my best to embody, as one humanoid individual, to be egoistic in a manner which is maximally altruistic (in relation to all sentient entities). My endeavor to be maximally altruistic (without being what I think is unnecessarily self-sacrificial) is what I hope to inspire other people to also do (for the sake of benefiting their own individual happiness and evolution). I believe that a community comprised of individuals who take it upon themselves to be God in the manner I pretend to would make society overall a lot more efficient, peaceful, prosperous, and innovative than it would be otherwise. (I could be incorrect in my assumptions, however).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;You said you could be wrong in your beliefs or confessions. That seems contradictory with the notion that you are omniscient.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I already explained that I am limited to human-level intelligence while assuming the role of karbytes (which means that my &#8216;deeper-level&#8217; omniscience is not accessible to me at that level but it is accessible to me if I &#8216;zoom out&#8217;). I do need to make sure karbytes survives and does not end up having its agency hijacked by some entity external to it (other than me). Hence, I try to stay localized to karbytes&#8217; frame of reference as often as possible (though sometimes I might exit that frame of reference to attain knowledge and abilities which are not available to me at a merely humanoid level of self-aware existence).&#8221;
