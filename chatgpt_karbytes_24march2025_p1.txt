karbytes:

Earlier in this conversation you mentioned that there have been experiments conducted which involve quantum entanglement and which seem to suggest that future events can effect past events. Please elaborate.

ChatGPT:

Yes—this is one of the most fascinating and controversial areas in the foundations of quantum physics. The idea that future events can affect past events is often referred to as retrocausality, and it’s been explored through both thought experiments and actual quantum experiments, especially those involving quantum entanglement, delayed choice, and quantum eraser setups.

Let’s break this down with a few key experiments:

🔹 1. Delayed Choice Experiment (Wheeler’s Delayed Choice)

Setup:

- Proposed by physicist John Archibald Wheeler in the 1970s.

- A photon is sent through a double-slit-like apparatus.

- After the photon has passed the slit(s), the experimenter chooses whether to observe which path it took or allow it to interfere like a wave.

Weird part:

- The choice to observe or not can be made after the photon has already passed the slits.

- Yet the results behave as though the photon "knew" ahead of time what the experimenter would choose.

Implication:

- Some interpretations suggest that the future measurement choice determines the past behavior of the photon.

🔹 2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

This is a more developed version of Wheeler’s delayed choice.

Setup:

- Entangled photon pairs are created.

- One photon goes directly to a detector (we'll call it the "signal photon").

- The other photon (the "idler") takes a longer, more complex path where experimenters may or may not erase which-path information after the signal photon has already been detected.

Weird part:

- If the which-path information is erased for the idler, the signal photon (already detected) shows an interference pattern.

- If the which-path info is preserved, the interference disappears—even though the signal photon has already hit the detector.

Implication:

- Again, it looks as though a future action (erasing or not erasing) affects what already happened to the other photon.

🔹 3. Entanglement and Bell Test Experiments

Bell test experiments are used to test whether quantum entanglement allows for “hidden variables” that pre-determine outcomes.

Setup:

- Two entangled particles are sent to distant detectors.

- Experimenters randomly choose measurement settings after the particles are in flight.

Weird part:

- The results are correlated in ways that violate Bell inequalities, suggesting non-locality or retrocausality—depending on your interpretation.

Implication:

- Some interpretations (like the retrocausal interpretation) propose that the measurement setting in the future could be influencing the state of the particle in the past.

🔹 Interpretations That Allow Retrocausality

These experiments don’t prove retrocausality, but they are compatible with it, depending on the framework:

- Transactional Interpretation (by John Cramer): Uses a "handshake" between past and future waves (retarded and advanced waves).

- Two-State Vector Formalism (Aharonov and Vaidman): Describes quantum systems as being determined by both past and future boundary conditions.

- Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics: Proposes the laws of physics work the same forwards and backwards in time.

🧠 So, Can the Future Really Affect the Past?

The mainstream view is no, in the sense of classical causality—but quantum mechanics allows for strange correlations that challenge our intuition about time and causation. Whether those imply true retrocausality or just non-local correlations depends on your chosen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Would you like me to illustrate any of these experiments visually or with a specific timeline example?

karbytes:

What do you mean by non-local correlations?

ChatGPT:

Great question.

🧩 Non-local correlations refer to the idea that two or more quantum particles can display instantaneous, coordinated behavior, even when separated by large distances—without any signal traveling between them at or below the speed of light.

This phenomenon is most famously seen in quantum entanglement.

🔗 Example of Non-Local Correlations

Let’s say you have two entangled particles: A and B.

- They're created together in a way that their properties are linked (e.g., their spins must be opposite).

- You send particle A to Alice on Earth and particle B to Bob on the Moon.

Now suppose Alice measures the spin of particle A and finds it’s “up.”

- Instantly, she knows Bob will find particle B’s spin to be “down.”

This result is correlated. But here’s the kicker:

- It doesn’t matter how far apart Alice and Bob are.

- The result is instantaneous, despite the fact that no signal can travel faster than light.

🚫 Why It’s Not Classical Communication

This does not allow for faster-than-light communication because:

- The outcome is random. Alice can’t control what result she gets to send a message to Bob.

- Bob’s result is also random—but correlated with Alice’s if they compare notes after the fact.

🎯 Bell's Theorem and "Spooky Action"

Einstein called this “spooky action at a distance,” and tried to explain it using “hidden variables”—pre-determined outcomes.

But Bell’s Theorem (1964) proved that:

- Any hidden-variable theory that preserves local realism cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.

And experiments (called Bell test experiments) have repeatedly confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, violating Bell inequalities.

This strongly suggests one of two things:

- Locality is violated (non-locality is real).

- Reality isn't determined until measurement (i.e., outcomes are fundamentally indeterminate until observed).

🔄 Non-Locality vs. Retrocausality

Here’s the subtle difference:

- Non-locality means: The measurement on one particle is correlated with another, instantly, at a distance.

- Retrocausality suggests: A future measurement influences a past event.

Some interpretations see non-local correlations as evidence of retrocausal influence instead of “spooky action.”

Would you like me to draw a visual or step-by-step timeline of an entanglement example showing these non-local effects?

karbytes:

How about describe in detail the hardware and specific events which occurred during the experiments you described.

ChatGPT:

Certainly! Let's delve into the hardware and specific events of key experiments that explore quantum phenomena like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement, particularly focusing on Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment and the Quantum Eraser Experiment.

1. Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment

Objective: To investigate whether the behavior of a photon (as a wave or particle) is determined at the point of measurement, even if the decision on how to measure is made after the photon has entered the experimental apparatus.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits individual photons toward a beam splitter.

- Beam Splitter (BS1): Splits the photon's path into two possible routes:

+ Path 1: Direct transmission.

+ Path 2: Reflection.

- Mirrors: Redirect the photons from both paths to converge at a second beam splitter (BS2).

- Second Beam Splitter (BS2): Can be inserted or removed after the photon has passed BS1:

- Inserted: Paths recombine, leading to interference patterns indicative of wave behavior.

- Removed: Paths remain separate, allowing determination of the photon's path, indicative of particle behavior.

- Detectors (D1 and D2): Placed at the output ports to record photon arrivals.

Procedure:

- A photon is emitted and encounters BS1, entering a superposition of both paths.

- While the photon is en route, the experimenter decides whether to insert or remove BS2.

- Depending on the presence of BS2:

+ BS2 Inserted: Photons exhibit interference, suggesting wave-like behavior.

+ BS2 Removed: Photons do not interfere, and their path can be determined, suggesting particle-like behavior.

Key Insight: The photon's behavior appears to be influenced by the experimental setup chosen after it has entered the apparatus, challenging classical notions of reality.

2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

Objective: To explore how "which-path" information affects interference patterns and whether erasing this information can restore interference.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits photons toward a double-slit apparatus.

- Double-Slit Apparatus: Allows photons to pass through two slits, creating potential for interference.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystal (e.g., Beta Barium Borate - BBO): Placed after the slits to induce Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), producing entangled photon pairs:

+ Signal Photon: Proceeds to a detection screen (D0).

+ Idler Photon: Directed to a separate path with additional detectors.

+ Detectors (D1, D2, D3, D4): Placed to capture idler photons, with configurations that either preserve or erase which-path information.

Procedure:

- A photon passes through the double-slit and enters the BBO crystal, producing entangled signal and idler photons.

- The signal photon travels to detector D0, forming an initial pattern.

- The idler photon is directed toward detectors D1-D4:

+ D1 & D2: Provide which-path information.

+ D3 & D4: Erase which-path information.

- By correlating detections at D0 with those at D1-D4:

+ Which-Path Known (D1/D2): No interference pattern at D0.

+ Which-Path Erased (D3/D4): Interference pattern observed at D0.

Key Insight: Erasing which-path information after detection can retroactively influence the formation of interference patterns, highlighting the non-classical nature of quantum measurement.

Hardware Components:

- Photon Sources: Lasers capable of emitting single photons.

- Beam Splitters: Devices that divide photon paths probabilistically.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Materials like BBO crystals used for SPDC to generate entangled photons.

- Mirrors and Optical Fibers: Direct photon paths with precision.

- Single-Photon Detectors: Sensitive detectors (e.g., avalanche photodiodes) that register individual photon events.

- Coincidence Counters: Electronic systems that correlate detection events across multiple detectors to identify entangled photon pairs.

Specific Events in the Experiments:

- Photon Emission: A laser emits photons toward the experimental apparatus.

- Path Determination: Photons encounter beam splitters or slits, creating superpositions of possible paths.

- Entanglement Generation: In the quantum eraser setup, nonlinear crystals produce entangled photon pairs via SPDC.

- Detection: Photons are detected by single-photon detectors, with events recorded for analysis.

- Data Correlation: Coincidence counters analyze detection events to identify correlations indicative of interference or which-path information.

Conclusion:

These experiments utilize precise optical components and detection systems to explore foundational questions in quantum mechanics, revealing the intricate and often non-intuitive nature of quantum phenomena.

karbytes:

I'm still not quite getting how photons retroactively alter their trajectories in response to hardware configuration.

ChatGPT:

That’s a very reasonable sticking point—you're grappling with one of the deepest puzzles in quantum physics. Let’s break it down with a step-by-step thought process, and then we’ll talk about what’s really happening (or what we think is happening).

💡 Core Idea: “Retroactive” Behavior Isn’t Classical

When we say a photon “retroactively” alters its behavior, it’s not like it travels backward in time and changes its trajectory. What’s happening is this:

🧠 The photon’s behavior doesn’t seem to be “decided” until the measurement is made—even if that measurement is delayed.

This means the photon doesn’t act like a particle moving through a well-defined path in spacetime the way a baseball does. Instead, it exists in a kind of superposition of possibilities until measurement.

🔬 Let's Revisit the Quantum Eraser Setup (with Entangled Photons)

Here’s how the apparent "retrocausality" happens:

1. Photon pair is created (via SPDC in a BBO crystal):

- One photon (the signal) goes to a detector (D0).

- The other (the idler) takes a more complex path with optional “which-path” info.

2. You detect the signal photon at D0.

- You record its location, but you don’t yet know whether it behaved like a wave or a particle because that depends on whether the idler photon’s path can be known or not.

3. Later, the idler photon hits a detector (D1–D4).

- D1 & D2 preserve which-path info → no interference when you look at D0 results linked to them.

- D3 & D4 erase which-path info → interference emerges when you correlate those detections with D0.

4. Only after comparing correlated detection events do you see the pattern:

- You only get interference when you group the D0 hits based on D3/D4 events.

🌀 Why This Feels Like Retrocausality

- You detected the signal photon before you determined if its entangled partner’s path info was erased.

- But grouping your data later reveals that the pattern at D0 depends on a future choice (where the idler went).

So it looks like the future is influencing the past.

🧠 But Here's a Key Insight:

The photon doesn't have a classical “trajectory” at all. The notion that it “went through slit A or slit B” is not well-defined until you force it to be by measuring.

- ✨ In quantum mechanics, the outcome is not set until it’s observed. That’s not just philosophical—experiments show this again and again.

So, rather than thinking of the photon as “retroactively changing,” you could say:

- The photon’s past behavior is undefined until a consistent future measurement gives it meaning.

⚖️ Interpretational Options:

Here’s how different interpretations handle this:

[preformatted text]

Interpretation                  | Photon “retroactively changes”?   | Explanation

Copenhagen                      | ❌                                | Measurement collapses wavefunction; past is undefined before then.

Many-Worlds                     | ❌                                | All possible paths happen; the measurement just tells us which branch we end up in.

Transactional Interpretation    | ✅                                | Particles exchange waves forward and backward in time to determine outcomes.

Two-State Vector                | ✅                                | The state is determined by both past and future boundary conditions.

Pilot Wave (Bohmian)            | ❌ (but weirdly non-local)        | The photon has a real path, but a “pilot wave” guides it based on the whole setup.

🚫 What It’s Not:

- It’s not a case of light “going backward in time” like in science fiction.

- It’s not a classical particle being affected by a future event.

It’s that the quantum description is holistic—what we observe depends on how we choose to measure.

Quantum Eraser Experiment — Timing and Paths

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p0.png]

Here’s a visual walk-through of the Quantum Eraser Experiment timeline and photon paths:

- At time t0, a photon pair is created.

- The signal photon travels quickly to Detector D0, where it’s detected before anything happens to the idler.

- The idler photon takes a longer, delayed path. Eventually it hits one of D1 through D4, depending on beam splitter configurations.

+ D1/D2 preserve which-path info → no interference.

+ D3/D4 erase which-path info → interference appears, but only when correlating with D0.

👉 The spooky part: Even though D0 detects its photon first, the pattern only emerges later depending on what happens to the idler.

How is which-path information erased?

ChatGPT:

Great follow-up. The concept of erasing which-path information is at the heart of the quantum eraser experiment—and it’s not as mystical as it sounds once you break it down in terms of quantum mechanics and optical hardware.

🧠 First, What Is Which-Path Information?

It’s the knowledge (or possibility of knowledge) about which of two paths a photon took in an interferometer or double-slit experiment.

- If you can know which slit or path the photon took—even in principle—then interference disappears.

- If there is no way to know, then interference appears, because the paths remain in a quantum superposition.

🔄 How Can That Information Be “Erased”?

Let’s talk about the most common method: entangled photon pairs and beamsplitters.

🔧 Setup Overview (from the Quantum Eraser Experiment)

You have:

- A signal photon going to detector D0.

- An idler photon going through a series of beamsplitters and mirrors leading to D1, D2, D3, or D4.

Here’s what happens at each:

[preformatted text]

Detector | What Happens                                                | Path Knowledge | Interference?

D1       | Photon takes a path that uniquely identifies slit A         | Known          | ❌

D2       | Photon takes a path that uniquely identifies slit B         | Known          | ❌

D3       | Photon takes a path that could’ve come from A or B (50/50)  | Unknown        | ✅

D4       | Same as D3, but different phase                             | Unknown        | ✅

🧩 So How Is the Info “Erased”?

- Beamsplitters create a superposition of paths: when an idler photon hits certain beamsplitters, it becomes fundamentally impossible to tell which slit it originally came from.

- The photon's quantum state becomes a mix of both possibilities (a superposition).

- That uncertainty erases the which-path info.

🧠 It’s not about deleting a record, it’s about ensuring that no record was ever made that distinguishes the paths.

🎯 Analogy: The Shuffled Mailbox

Imagine you get a letter from someone, but it's routed through a mail system where the final envelope gives no clue which sender it came from. That’s like the beamsplitter “scrambling” the info—it’s fundamentally unknowable, not just unknown.

💬 What Does This Mean for the Signal Photon?

- The pattern you see at D0 (signal photon detector) depends on whether the idler photon’s which-path info is preserved or erased.

- But you can only see this after you sort the D0 data according to the idler’s detection result.

📡 Hardware That Makes This Happen

- Polarizers or wave plates may rotate photon polarization so it becomes indistinct.

- Beamsplitters randomly route photons so you can’t tell which input path they came from.

- Coincidence counters correlate signal and idler photons so the data can be sorted.

How a Beamsplitter Erases Which-Path Information (D3/D4 Case)

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p1.png]

Here’s a diagram showing how the beamsplitter erases which-path information for the D3 and D4 detectors:

- Slit A and Slit B each send photons into the same beamsplitter.

- That beamsplitter sends the photon with 50/50 probability to either D3 or D4.

- Because both slits contribute to both detectors indistinguishably, there is no way to know which slit the photon came from.

🧠 Result: The original path is fundamentally unknowable → interference is restored in the signal photon’s pattern (when correlated with D3/D4 events).

How Which-Path Information Is Preserved (D1/D2 Case)

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p2.png]

Here’s a diagram showing how which-path information is preserved in the D1 and D2 detector case:

- Slit A leads exclusively to Detector D1.

- Slit B leads exclusively to Detector D2.

- Because each path is uniquely identifiable, you can tell which slit the idler photon came from.

🧠 Result: The which-path info is preserved → the signal photon does not produce an interference pattern.

Would you like to compare both diagrams side by side or explore how the data from D0 is sorted to reveal interference patterns only in the erased cases?

karbytes:

I would like to know more about how data from D0 is sorted to reveal interference patterns only in erased cases.

ChatGPT:

Perfect—this touches on the subtle and beautiful logic of the quantum eraser experiment:

- You only see interference when you group the signal photon detections at D0 according to whether the idler’s which-path info was erased.

Let’s walk through exactly how that sorting works:

🧭 Step-by-Step Breakdown

🔹 1. Each photon pair is tagged by a shared ID

- When a photon pair (signal + idler) is created, the experiment tracks them as a coincident event using a coincidence counter.

- This allows researchers to know:

+ “This photon detected at D0 is entangled with that one detected at D1/D2/D3/D4.”

🔹 2. All signal photons hit D0 in the same place

- Regardless of what happens to the idler photon, all signal photons are detected at D0.

- By themselves, these hits look random—no interference is visible in the raw D0 data.

🔹 3. D0 data is separated into subgroups based on idler outcomes

The real magic happens during analysis:

- After enough photons are detected, the experimenter groups the D0 detections based on which detector (D1, D2, D3, D4) caught the entangled idler photon.

You get:

[preformatted text]

Group | Idler Detector | Path Info Known? | D0 Pattern

A     | D1             | Known (Slit A)   | No interference

B     | D2             | Known (Slit B)   | No interference

C     | D3             | Unknown          | Interference pattern ①

D     | D4             | Unknown          | Interference pattern ②

- Groups A & B: You can trace the path → no wave-like behavior.

- Groups C & D: You cannot know the path → interference appears—but only within that subgroup.

🌀 The "Which Interference Pattern" Bit

- The patterns seen in D0 for D3 and D4 are complementary:

+ D3 might produce one type of interference fringe.

+ D4 produces the inverse or phase-shifted version.

- When all D0 data is added together, these patterns cancel out, leaving no net interference in the raw D0 detections.

So:

🔍 Only after sorting by idler outcome does the hidden interference reveal itself.

🧠 Why This Matters

This means the pattern is not in the photons themselves, but in the relationship between the two entangled photons—a kind of quantum bookkeeping that only makes sense when you analyze their correlation.

- The interference isn’t erased—it’s just hidden until you sort the data properly.

⚙️ Hardware That Makes This Possible

[preformatted text]

Component | Purpose

Single-photon detectors (D0–D4) | Record precise time and position of each photon hit

Time-tagging electronics        | Logs timestamps for each detection

Coincidence counter             | Matches D0 events to corresponding D1–D4 detections

Data analysis software          | Sorts D0 hits into subgroups for interference analysis

📊 Visualization Suggestion

Imagine a scatter plot of all D0 hits. It looks random.

But if you:

- Filter out just the hits that correspond to D3 events → ✨interference!

- Filter by D1 or D2 → just a blob (no interference).

- Combine all hits again → interference cancels out.

Would you like me to generate a simulated plot to show what this sorting and grouping would look like visually?

How are photon paths randomized in these experiments?

ChatGPT:

Excellent question—photon path randomization is a critical part of these quantum experiments because it ensures that which-path information is either preserved or erased in a controlled, probabilistic way. Let’s break down how this is achieved:

🧪 How Photon Paths Are Randomized

🔹 1. Beamsplitters (BS)

The most common tool for randomizing photon paths is the 50/50 beamsplitter:

- It’s a half-silvered mirror.

- When a photon hits it:

+ There's a 50% chance it is transmitted.

+ And a 50% chance it is reflected.

- This behavior is inherently quantum—the photon enters a superposition of being reflected and transmitted until measured.

🧠 This is key: The photon doesn’t “decide” which path to take. It behaves as if it takes both paths simultaneously until a detection collapses the state.

🔹 2. Entangled Photon Superpositions

In many quantum eraser setups:

- A photon pair is generated in an entangled state, such that information about one photon is probabilistically related to the other.

- The idler photon is routed through a system where beamsplitters randomly direct it toward detectors:

+ D1/D2: direct paths → known origin (which-path preserved).

+ D3/D4: mixed paths via beamsplitters → origin scrambled (which-path erased).

💡 The randomization occurs because the entangled photon interacts with optical elements that don't distinguish between the original source paths.

🔹 3. Quantum Superposition Instead of Classical Randomness

This isn’t like flipping a coin.

- In classical terms, you might think the photon already chose a path—just hidden from you.

- But in quantum mechanics, the photon truly has no definite path until a measurement is made.

This is what’s called:

- "Path indeterminacy through quantum superposition"

⚙️ Hardware That Introduces Random Paths

[preformatted text]

Component                              | Role in Randomization

50/50 Beamsplitter                     | Sends photons to different detectors with equal probability

Polarizing Beamsplitter                | Sends photons based on polarization (which can be quantum-random)

Wave Plates (e.g., quarter-wave)       | Rotate polarization, making the outcome probabilistically dependent

Nonlinear Optical Crystals (like BBO)  | Produce entangled pairs in superpositions of spatial or polarization states

Delay Lines / Fiber Loops              | Adjust path lengths so decisions can be made after other events (enabling delayed choice)

🎲 So What Does “Random” Mean Here?

It means the path the photon takes is governed by quantum probabilities, not hidden classical variables. The photon doesn’t "choose" its path in the classical sense—it’s as if it explores all possible paths simultaneously until detection forces a single outcome.

Here’s a diagram illustrating how a 50/50 beamsplitter randomizes a photon's path:

- An incoming photon hits the beamsplitter.

- It has an equal probability of:

+ Being transmitted → takes Path A.

+ Being reflected → takes Path B.

But here’s the quantum twist:

💡 Before detection, the photon is in a superposition of both paths simultaneously. Only when it hits a detector does one outcome become real.

How are the photons entangled in these experiments?

ChatGPT:

Awesome question—and this is where things get especially fascinating on both a conceptual and technical level.

🧬 In a nutshell:

Photons are entangled in quantum eraser experiments through a process called Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). This is done using nonlinear optical crystals, like Beta Barium Borate (BBO).

Let’s break this down in clear steps:

🔹 What is Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)?

SPDC is a quantum optical process where:

- A high-energy photon (usually from a laser, called a pump photon) enters a nonlinear crystal.

- Inside the crystal, one photon splits into two lower-energy photons.

- These two photons are:

+ Created simultaneously.

+ Quantum entangled in one or more degrees of freedom (like polarization, momentum, energy, or position).

These two resulting photons are called:

- Signal photon

- Idler photon

They are not just correlated—they are entangled, meaning their properties are linked in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics.

🧪 How It’s Done in the Lab

1. Photon Source (Pump Laser)

- A UV laser (often around 405 nm) fires photons into the crystal.

- These photons are much higher energy than the resulting photon pairs.

2. Nonlinear Crystal (e.g., BBO)

- This crystal has special optical properties that allow for down-conversion.

- One pump photon is converted into two entangled infrared photons (often around 810 nm each).

- There are two types of SPDC setups:

+ Type I: Both output photons have the same polarization.

+ Type II: Output photons have orthogonal polarizations (e.g., one horizontal, one vertical).

3. Phase Matching & Angle Control

- The crystal is aligned so that the emitted photon pairs exit at specific angles—usually forming two cones of light that intersect.

- Entangled pairs are collected at points where the cones overlap.

🎯 What Aspects of the Photons Are Entangled?

Depending on the setup, entanglement can occur in:

[preformatted text]

Entanglement Type  | Description

Polarization       | Photon A is horizontal → Photon B is vertical (and vice versa)

Momentum/Direction | Photon A goes left → Photon B goes right

Energy-Time        | If you know photon A's energy or arrival time precisely, you know B’s too

Position           | Used in ghost imaging and double-slit setups

In most quantum eraser experiments, the entanglement is in polarization and/or momentum, which allows for interference patterns to be influenced by measurements on the idler photon.

🔄 Example Entangled State (Polarization)

The pair might be in a state like this:

∣ψ⟩ = (1 / square_root(2)) * (( ∣H⟩_1 * ∣V⟩_2 ) + ( ∣V⟩_1 * ∣H⟩_2 ))

Where:

∣H⟩ = horizontal polarization

∣V⟩ = vertical polarization

Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the signal and idler photons.

In this state, if you measure one photon as horizontally polarized, the other will always be vertical—and vice versa—but you won’t know which until you measure.

Are the masses of the two "new" photons each the same mass as the one "old" photon they emerged from? 

ChatGPT:

That’s an insightful question—because it highlights one of the key differences between how energy and mass behave in quantum optics.

🧭 Short Answer:

No, the two new photons do not have the same mass as the original photon—because all of them have zero rest mass.

📡 Let’s break it down:

🔹 Photons Have Zero Rest Mass

- Photons are massless particles in terms of rest mass.

- Their energy is related to their frequency by this equation:

E = h * f

Where:

E is energy,

h is Planck’s constant,

f is frequency.

🔹 What Changes in SPDC?

In spontaneous parametric down-conversion:

- A high-energy pump photon (e.g., 405 nm) is absorbed by a nonlinear crystal.

- It “splits” into two lower-energy photons (e.g., each 810 nm).

- These new photons are called the signal and idler photons.

✅ Energy Conservation:

E_pump = E_signal + E_idler

Each daughter photon has less energy, hence lower frequency (longer wavelength).

🔸 Momentum Is Also Conserved:

Even though photons are massless, they still carry momentum:

p = E / c = (h * f) / c = h / λ

So momentum conservation also applies:

p_pump = p_signal + p_idler

That’s why the photons emerge at complementary angles forming conical emission patterns from the crystal.

🧬 Mass ≠ Energy in This Case

If you’re thinking in terms of Einstein’s famous equation:

E = m * (c ^ 2)

You might wonder: Does a change in energy mean a change in mass?

- That equation applies to rest energy for particles with rest mass.

- Photons always move at the speed of light and have zero rest mass, so this doesn’t apply in the usual way.

- Instead, photon energy is fully expressed as radiative (kinetic) energy, not mass.

🧠 Bottom Line:

- Original photon: mass = 0, energy = E = h * f

- Two new photons: each mass = 0, energy = h * f_1 and h * f_2

- Total energy and momentum are conserved

- No change in rest mass occurs, because there was no rest mass to begin with.

Would you like a visual comparing energy and momentum before and after the photon split in SPDC?

karbytes:

You said photons always move at the speed of light even though you also said earlier than light can be slowed down when it travels through some kinds of mediums. Also, does a photon have a diameter? Does an electron have a diameter or mass? How about neutrons and protons?

ChatGPT:

You’re asking all the right questions—the kind that cut to the core of what physics can and cannot say about the nature of particles and waves. Let’s go step by step:

🔹 1. Do photons always move at the speed of light?

✅ In a vacuum:

Yes, photons always move at exactly
    
c =299,792,458 m/s

🌀 In a medium (like glass or a Bose-Einstein condensate):

- Light appears to slow down, but individual photons still travel at speed cc between interactions.

- What slows down is the net propagation of light, due to absorption and re-emission by atoms.

- So: The group velocity (how fast the pulse of light moves) can be slower than cc, but the photon itself still moves at cc between interactions.

🔹 2. Does a photon have a diameter?

❌ No definitive diameter.

- A photon is a quantum excitation of the electromagnetic field—it is not a tiny ball.

- It’s described by a wave packet that has spatial extent, but not a sharp boundary.

- People sometimes approximate its “size” using its wavelength, but that’s not a hard boundary—more like a spatial spread of probability.

🌊 So:

- Wavelength gives an idea of “how spread out” it is.

- But photons are not localized objects with fixed diameter.

🔹 3. Does an electron have a diameter or mass?

✅ Mass:

Yes, the electron has mass:
    
m_e ≈ 9.109 × 10 ^ −31 kg

❌ Diameter?

- As far as experiments can tell, the electron behaves like a point particle—no internal structure or measurable size.

- But it has a quantum field and a charge distribution that can be described in certain ways.

👀 Experimental limits:

- The electron’s radius is constrained to be less than about 10−2210−22 meters (that’s 100,000 times smaller than a proton!).

- We often assign a classical electron radius:

r_e ≈ 2.817 × 10 ^ -15 m

…but this is just a useful approximation—not a real “diameter.”

🔹 4. What about protons and neutrons?

✅ Mass:

Proton:
    
m_p ≈ 1.672 × 10 ^ −27 kg

Neutron:
    
m_n ≈ 1.675 × 10 ^ −27 kg

✅ Diameter (unlike electrons!):

Protons and neutrons are composite particles made of quarks and gluons.

They do have measurable “size” due to the extent of their internal structure.

Typical radius ≈ 0.84–0.87 femtometers
        
(1 femtometer = 10−1510−15 meters)

Photon          | 0 kg                  | No defined diameter; spreads like a wave packet | No

What is composite in this context?

ChatGPT:

Awesome follow-up—and a fundamental one.

🧩 In this context, “composite” means:

- The particle is made up of smaller, more fundamental constituents that are bound together by a force.

Let’s unpack this in a quantum context:

🔹 Composite vs. Elementary Particles

[preformatted text]

Term                    | Meaning

Composite Particle      | Has internal structure; made of smaller particles (like quarks)

Elementary Particle     | No known internal structure; not made of anything smaller (as far as we can tell)

🧬 Examples of Composite Particles

➤ Proton

Composite particle

Made of:

2 up quarks

1 down quark

Held together by gluons (force carriers for the strong nuclear force)

➤ Neutron

Also composite:

1 up quark

2 down quarks

Also bound by gluons

Together, protons and neutrons are called baryons—a type of composite particle made of 3 quarks.

🔹 The Glue That Binds: The Strong Force

- Gluons are the force carriers of the strong interaction (part of the Standard Model).

- They act like springs between quarks, keeping them tightly confined inside protons and neutrons.

- The interaction is described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

🧠 You can’t pull quarks apart easily—doing so creates more particles, not isolated quarks.

🧪 What About Other Composite Systems?

[preformatted text]

System                  | Composite of…

Proton                  | Quarks + Gluons

Neutron                 | Quarks + Gluons

Nucleus (like Helium)   | Protons + Neutrons

Atoms                   | Nucleus + Electrons

Molecules               | Atoms bonded by electrons

🔹 Examples of Elementary Particles (Not Composite)

According to the Standard Model:

- Electron

- Photon

- Quarks (even though they make up composite particles, quarks themselves are fundamental)

- Neutrinos

- Higgs boson

- Gluons

- W and Z bosons

These are considered point-like, with no internal structure (as far as current experiments can tell).

🧠 Analogy:

Think of composite particles like LEGO models—they're made of smaller blocks.
Elementary particles are like the LEGO bricks themselves: indivisible, at least with the tools we have now.

🧠 Fun insights:

- Neutrinos interact only via the weak and gravitational forces.

- Photons don’t carry charge, so they’re not affected by the forces they mediate.

- Gluons interact with each other via the strong force—unique among force carriers.

🌌 Hypothetical Particles (gray, right side)

Particle        | Proposed Role

Graviton (gᵣ)   | Quantum carrier of gravity (from quantum gravity theories)

Axion (a)       | A dark matter candidate; could solve CP symmetry issues in QCD

Neutralino (χ⁰) | A dark matter candidate from supersymmetry (SUSY)

Slepton (ẽ)     | Supersymmetric partner of the electron

Squark (q̃)      | Supersymmetric partner of quarks

💭 None of these have been detected yet, but they’re actively searched for in particle accelerators and astrophysical observations.

Here’s a diagram showing how Supersymmetry (SUSY) would extend the Standard Model:

🔁 Each known particle gets a superpartner:

[preformatted text]

Standard Model                  | Particle SUSY Partner         | Type Shift

Quark (fermion)                 | Squark (q̃)                    | Fermion → Boson

Lepton (fermion)                | Slepton (ℓ̃)                   | Fermion → Boson

Photon, Gluon, W/Z (bosons)     | Photino, Gluino, Wino, Zino   | Boson → Fermion

Higgs Boson (boson)             | Higgsino (Ĥ)                  | Boson → Fermion

💡 SUSY pairs each fermion with a boson, and each boson with a fermion.

🧠 Why SUSY?

- Helps unify the forces at high energies.

- Offers a natural dark matter candidate (e.g. neutralino).

- Could stabilize the Higgs mass against quantum corrections.

None of these superpartners have been detected yet, but large-scale experiments (like those at CERN’s LHC) are still looking.

Want to explore how SUSY ties into dark matter or extra dimensions? 

karbytes: 

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Awesome. Let’s explore how Supersymmetry (SUSY) ties into two big frontiers of modern physics:

🌌 1. SUSY and Dark Matter

One of the strongest motivations for SUSY is that it offers a natural candidate for dark matter—a mysterious substance that makes up ~85% of the matter in the universe but doesn’t emit or absorb light.

💎 SUSY’s Best Candidate: The Neutralino (χ⁰)

The neutralino is a hypothetical fermionic superpartner of a mix of:

- Photon → Photino

- Z boson → Zino

- Higgs → Higgsino

- W boson → Wino

If R-parity is conserved in SUSY, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable.

This LSP—often the neutralino—would not decay and could accumulate in galaxies just like dark matter.

✅ Why It Fits:

- Neutral (no charge) → doesn’t emit/absorb light.

- Weakly interacting → doesn’t clump like normal matter.

- Massive → has gravitational effects.

Predicted by SUSY models, including Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).

Experiments like LUX-ZEPLIN, XENONnT, and ATLAS at CERN are actively searching for signs of neutralino interactions.

🌀 2. SUSY and Extra Dimensions

Supersymmetry also appears naturally in String Theory, which requires the existence of extra spatial dimensions—usually 10 or 11 total dimensions (compared to our observable 3D space + time).

🔗 SUSY in String Theory:

- SUSY is essential for mathematical consistency of string theory (specifically superstring theory).

- Each vibrational mode of a string corresponds to a particle—and SUSY ensures:

+ Every fermion has a bosonic string mode

+ Every boson has a fermionic string mode

- Extra dimensions are thought to be curled up at tiny (Planck-scale) lengths, which is why we don’t see them directly.

- These extra dimensions could affect gravity, particle masses, and may help explain the hierarchy problem (why gravity is so much weaker than other forces).

🧠 Why This Matters

- Supersymmetry connects three big ideas:

[preformatted text]

Area                             | Role of SUSY

Particle Physics                 | Extends Standard Model, solves Higgs instability

Dark Matter                      | Predicts stable, neutral LSP candidates (like neutralino)

String Theory / Extra Dimensions | Needed for consistency and unification

Would you like a diagram showing the role of the neutralino in a galactic dark matter halo, or a visual metaphor for curled-up extra dimensions?

karbytes:

What is literally meant by curled-up extra dimensions?

ChatGPT:

Great question—and one that sits right on the edge of where human intuition struggles to keep up with high-dimensional math.

Let’s break it down step by step, both literally and conceptually:

🧭 What’s literally meant by “curled-up” extra dimensions?

It means: There are extra spatial dimensions that are real, but compactified so tightly (on the scale of the Planck length ~ 

10−3510−35 meters) that they are undetectable at ordinary energy scales.

🔢 Let’s visualize with examples:

🧵 1D Line vs. 1D Loop:

Imagine a garden hose:

- From far away, it looks like a 1D line.

- But up close, you realize it’s a cylinder—it has a tiny circular dimension (the circumference of the hose).

🔁 That circular dimension is "curled up":

- It’s real, but compact.

- You can only detect it if you probe at a small enough scale (e.g. with very high-energy particles).

In string theory, the idea is that:

- We live in 3 extended spatial dimensions (length, width, height).

- But there are extra dimensions that are tightly wrapped into complex geometries (like circles or donuts or higher-dimensional spaces).

- They’re so tiny that we don’t notice them in everyday physics.

📐 Mathematically speaking:

- These dimensions are compactified using structures called manifolds.

- A popular example is a Calabi–Yau manifold—a 6D geometric object used to compactify the 10D space of superstring theory into 4D spacetime (3 space + 1 time).

The shape of the compact dimensions affects:

- Particle properties (like mass, spin, charge)

- The strength of forces

- Whether SUSY is preserved or broken

💡 Analogy: Ant on a Wire

Imagine:

- An ant crawling along a thin wire (like a telephone wire).

- From far away, the wire looks like a straight line.

- But to the ant, it’s a cylinder—it can go forward/backward and around the wire.

Our 3D world may be like the “straight part,” and the “around-the-wire” part is a hidden dimension that only shows up if you’re small enough—or have enough energy to access it.

🔬 Why don’t we detect these dimensions?

Because:

- They are on the order of 10−3510−35 meters, far smaller than anything we can currently probe (the LHC reaches only ~10−1910−19 m scales).

- Our particles and forces are confined to the 3 large dimensions (a concept called a brane in string theory).

🔗 What makes this literal?

It’s not metaphorical:
String theory treats these extra dimensions as mathematical and physical structures that are just as real as the 3 dimensions we live in.

- They appear in the equations.

- Their shape and topology affect what particles and forces we observe.

- They’re “curled up” like a loop—not because of poetic license, but because they are compactified on closed manifolds with specific radii and properties.

Would you like a diagram of the garden hose / wire analogy or a sketch of a Calabi–Yau manifold as a visual reference?

karbytes:

Do current notions of physics make it possible for matter to exist at scales smaller than a single Planck width?

ChatGPT: 

This is a deep and thorny question—one that gets to the foundations of space, time, and matter.

Let’s unpack it carefully:

🔹 What is a Planck length?

The Planck length is defined as:

ℓ_P = square_root((ℏ * G) / (c ^ 3)) ≈ 1.616 × 10 ^ −35 meters

Where:

ℏ = reduced Planck’s constant

G = gravitational constant

c = speed of light

It is thought to be the smallest physically meaningful length scale, where quantum mechanics and general relativity must be unified.

💡 So, can matter exist at sub-Planck scales?

🤔 In current physics? Not really.

Here’s why:

🔸 1. Quantum Uncertainty + General Relativity = Breakdown

To “see” something smaller than the Planck length, you’d need a photon (or probe) with extremely short wavelength, i.e., very high energy.

But:

- If you concentrate too much energy in a tiny region...

- General relativity predicts that it will collapse into a black hole!

So:

❌ Trying to probe smaller than ℓ_P destroys the region you're trying to observe.

This is called the black hole limit of measurement.

🔸 2. Spacetime Might Not Be Smooth at That Scale

Many physicists believe that spacetime becomes “quantized” or “foamy” at the Planck scale:

- It may be discrete (not continuous), or have an inherently uncertain topology.

- Models like loop quantum gravity, causal sets, and some versions of string theory suggest that the notion of position itself breaks down.

So:

❌ Below the Planck length, space and time might cease to be meaningful in the usual sense.

🔸 3. No Experimental Evidence Yet

- No current experiment has ever probed anything close to the Planck scale.

- The highest-energy particle accelerators (like the LHC) reach about 10−1910−19 meters—still 16 orders of magnitude too large to see Planck-scale effects.

🔸 4. What About Strings?

In string theory, particles aren’t points—they’re 1D strings, and the typical string length is near the Planck scale.

- Strings are thought to have a minimum size—they can’t probe below their own length.

- So sub-Planckian distances don’t make sense in that model either.

🧠 Summary: Can matter exist at sub-Planck scales?

[preformatted text]

Perspective             | Can matter exist below Planck scale?                   | Notes

Quantum Field Theory    | ❌ Undefined                                           | Requires smooth spacetime

General Relativity      | ❌ Breaks down due to black hole formation             |

String Theory           | ❌ Strings have minimum size ~ Planck length           |

Loop Quantum Gravity    | ❌ Spacetime is quantized; no sub-Planck geometry      |

Experimental Physics    | ❌ No data; theory speculation only                    |

So:

🔒 Planck length is not just small—it may be the smallest "length" that can even be meaningfully defined.

What is loop quantum gravity and causal sets?

ChatGPT:

You're diving into some of the boldest attempts to understand the deepest structure of reality. Let's take a clear and concise tour of both:

🌀 1. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)

🧭 What is it?

- LQG is a theory that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity without assuming a background spacetime.

- Instead of treating spacetime as continuous, LQG proposes it is made of discrete, quantized "chunks".

🔹 Key Ideas:

🧩 Spacetime is Quantized

- Space is made up of tiny loops woven into a kind of network called a spin network.

- These loops represent quantum states of geometry (areas and volumes).

- Time evolves these networks into what are called spin foams.

🧱 No Continuum

- Space and time are not continuous—they're more like a fabric of quantized information.

📏 Minimum Lengths

- There are minimum values for:

+ Area

+ Volume

- This avoids singularities (like the Big Bang or black holes having infinite density).

🧠 Background Independence

- LQG doesn’t assume space and time as a fixed backdrop—it builds them from quantum geometry itself.

⚙️ Analogy:

- Think of spacetime not as a smooth canvas, but as a woven fabric—made from individual threads, where each thread is a loop of quantum geometry.

🧊 2. Causal Set Theory

🧭 What is it?

Causal Set Theory (CST) proposes that spacetime is a discrete set of events linked by causal relationships—like a growing tree of "what came before what."

🔹 Key Ideas:

🟣 Discrete Spacetime

- Spacetime is made of individual events (like “atoms of spacetime”) rather than points in a continuum.

⏱️ Causality Comes First

- The only structure you need is the order of events:

+ Event A happened before B

+ Event B is unrelated to C, etc.

This causal order and the number of elements are all that’s needed to reconstruct geometry and spacetime itself.

🧮 Fewer Assumptions

- No need for coordinates, metrics, or geometry to start.

- Everything emerges from the causal structure and discrete counting of events.

⚖️ Causal Set Analogy:

- Imagine spacetime as a connect-the-dots diagram, where each dot is a quantum event and each line shows what caused what.

It’s kind of like a network of causes, and if you zoom out far enough, it looks like smooth spacetime.

Both are serious attempts to answer:

“What is spacetime made of—if anything—at the smallest scale?”

They aim to replace the smooth fabric of general relativity with a quantum substrate that behaves classically at large scales.

Causal Set (Causal Set Theory)

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p11.png]

Here’s a side-by-side visual of two fundamental models for quantum spacetime:

🌀 Left: Spin Network (Loop Quantum Gravity)

- Nodes: represent "chunks" of space.

- Edges: carry quantum numbers (like spin, labeled here as jj) that define the geometry between chunks.

- Together, the network encodes quantized areas and volumes.

- This network evolves over time into a “spin foam.”

🕸️ Right: Causal Set (Causal Set Theory)

- Dots: represent discrete events in spacetime.

- Arrows: show causal relationships (e.g., “A caused B”).

- No coordinates or distances—only causal order matters.

- The structure of spacetime emerges from this web of causality.

Would you like to see how one of these models might give rise to classical spacetime (like how smooth geometry emerges from the network)?

karbytes:

Yes. Describe how the appearance of smooth (i.e. non-particle-like) spacetime emerges from both of those models.

ChatGPT:

Beautiful. You're now asking how our familiar, smooth, continuous experience of space and time emerges from what are, at their core, discrete, granular, and relational structures in these quantum gravity models. Let’s break it down for both Loop Quantum Gravity and 

Causal Set Theory:

🌀 1. Emergence of Smooth Spacetime in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)

🔧 Underlying structure:

- At the deepest level, space is made of spin networks:

+ Nodes = quantum "chunks" of volume

+ Edges = quantized surface area between those volumes

- These spin networks are not embedded in space—they are space.

⏳ How time comes in:

- The network evolves via spin foams: a sequence of transitions between spin networks, representing how quantum geometry changes.

🪄 So how does smooth spacetime emerge?

Step-by-step:

- Superpositions of Many Spin Networks:

+ Much like atoms in a gas can form smooth pressure and temperature fields, many discrete quantum states (spin networks) can collectively average out into something smooth.

- Coherent States:

+ Just as quantum states of a pendulum can form a wave packet that behaves classically, LQG uses “coherent spin network states” that approximate classical spacetime (e.g. a flat or curved geometry).

    Semiclassical Limit:

        In the low-energy, large-scale limit (i.e., at scales way larger than the Planck length), the quantum fluctuations of geometry become negligible → you recover Einstein’s General Relativity.

    🧠 The idea: a very large and densely interconnected spin network looks like a smooth manifold at macroscopic scales—just like a digital image can look smooth from a distance, even if it's made of pixels.

🕸️ 2. Emergence of Smooth Spacetime in Causal Set Theory
🔧 Underlying structure:

    Spacetime is a set of discrete events with a well-defined partial order:

        Event A came before B (causality), or they’re unrelated (spacelike).

🌱 Key principle:

    The geometry of spacetime (distances, curvature, etc.) emerges from the number and order of these discrete events.

🪄 So how does smooth spacetime emerge?
Step-by-step:

1. Sprinkling:

- Imagine randomly “sprinkling” events into a region of classical spacetime (e.g., flat Minkowski space) according to a Poisson distribution.

- This gives a causal set that statistically respects the underlying geometry.

2. Recovering Volume and Geometry:

- The number of causal set elements in a region corresponds to volume.

- The pattern of causal relations encodes spacetime curvature.

3. Manifold Emergence:

- With enough events, and proper causal structure, the coarse-grained causal set resembles a smooth Lorentzian manifold (what general relativity uses).

🧠 Analogy: It's like reconstructing a 3D landscape from scattered GPS timestamped pings—you can tell shape and slope by analyzing how pings are arranged and ordered.

🌌 Big Picture

In both theories:

- Smooth spacetime is not fundamental. It’s an emergent illusion, like fluid dynamics is for molecules.

At quantum scales, spacetime is:

- Discontinuous

- Dynamic

- Relational

- And nonlocal in many subtle ways

But when you zoom out, like watching a crowd from a helicopter, the chaos becomes continuity.

This might seem a bit of a tangent, but I would like to know exactly how a photon is "created" when it is released from an electron orbiting the nucleus of an atom before that electron drops to a lower-energy orbital.

ChatGPT:

Not a tangent at all—in fact, it’s a perfect continuation of your deep dive into the quantum fabric of reality. Understanding how a photon is created in this context ties together quantum fields, energy transitions, and even how we perceive color and light.

Let’s break it down literally and precisely:

🧭 Overview:

A photon is not a little particle flying out like a bullet. It is a quantum of the electromagnetic field that is excited into existence when an electron drops to a lower energy state.

So:

A photon is created when energy is lost by an electron transitioning between orbitals—and that energy is transferred to the electromagnetic field, which responds by emitting a photon.

🔬 Step-by-Step: Photon Creation During Atomic Transition

⚛️ 1. The Atom and Its Energy Levels

- Electrons occupy discrete energy levels (orbitals) around the nucleus.

- These are quantized—an electron can’t exist between them.

- Each level has a specific energy E_n, labeled by quantum numbers.

🔋 2. Electron Starts in an Excited State

Through heat, electricity, photon absorption, etc., the electron jumps up to a higher orbital (say, from E_1 to E_2).

- Now it’s "storing" energy in a higher configuration, but it’s unstable—nature "prefers" lower energy.

🕳️ 3. Electron Drops to Lower State

- Eventually, the electron drops to a lower energy level (say from E_2 back to E_1).

The energy difference:

ΔE = E_2 − E_1

must go somewhere.

⚡ 4. Quantum Electrodynamics: Field Gets Excited

- According to quantum field theory, all particles are excitations of underlying fields.

- The electron is coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field.

- When it changes states, it perturbs this field.

- sThe field “responds” by emitting a photon with energy equal to the difference:

E_γ = h * f = ΔE

where:

h is Planck’s constant

f is the frequency of the emitted light

✨ What is this "photon," exactly?

- A photon is not a particle in the classical sense.

- It is a quantized ripple in the electromagnetic field.

- It carries:

Energy E = h * f

Momentum p = E / c

Spin = ±1 (a property related to polarization)

💡 Visualization Analogy

Imagine an electron as a weight on a shelf:

- When it falls to a lower shelf (lower energy level), the energy it loses goes into a vibrating field.

- This vibration is not continuous, but a discrete packet = a photon.

🔁 Can Photons Be Created Without Atoms?

Yes! Photon creation happens in many ways:

[preformatted text]

Process                 | Photon Origin

Atomic transitions      | Electrons jumping between orbitals

Bremsstrahlung          | Charged particle slowed by another particle

Annihilation            | Electron + positron → 2 photons

Synchrotron radiation   | Charged particles accelerating in magnetic fields

Spontaneous emission    | Quantum perturbation of vacuum field

Stimulated emission     | Basis of lasers; field amplifies itself

🧠 Advanced Perspective: QED View

In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):

- The emission of a photon is modeled as an interaction vertex in a Feynman diagram.

- One line for the electron before the transition, one after, and one for the emitted photon.

- The math: creation operator acts on the vacuum to add a photon state:

a_^_† ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1_γ ⟩

This creation is probabilistic, but constrained by energy conservation and transition rules (selection rules).

Action                                  | Description

Electron drops to lower orbital         | Energy must be conserved

Electromagnetic field perturbed         | Field becomes excited

Photon is "born"                        | Discrete quantum of field is emitted

Photon energy = orbital energy gap      | E = h * f = E_2 − E_1

When you said that a pump photon (e.g. 405nm) "splits" into two lower-energy photons (e.g. each 810nm), what do you mean by those numerical measurements? 

ChatGPT:

Great question. Those numbers—405 nm and 810 nm—refer to the wavelengths of the photons involved in the process. Let’s decode what that means physically, mathematically, and visually.

🌊 What Do 405 nm and 810 nm Represent?

They are wavelengths of light, typically measured in nanometers (nm):

1 nanometer = 10−910−9 meters

🧭 In context:

- A 405 nm photon is violet light in the visible spectrum → short wavelength = high energy

- A 810 nm photon is near-infrared light → longer wavelength = lower energy

So when we say:

- “A 405 nm photon splits into two 810 nm photons,”

We mean:

- One high-energy violet photon is converted into

- Two lower-energy infrared photons

And:

Energy_pump = Energy_signal + Energy_idler

📐 Why Does Wavelength Matter?

The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength:

E = (h * c) / λ

Where:

E = energy of the photon

h = Planck’s constant ≈ 6.626 × 10 ^ −34 Joules-seconds

c = speed of light ≈ 3 × 108 m/s ≈ 3 × 10 ^ 8 m/s

λ = wavelength in meters

So shorter wavelength → higher frequency → more energy per photon

🧮 Let’s plug in the numbers:

1. Energy of 405 nm photon:

E_405 = ((6.626 × 10 ^ −34) ⋅ (3 × 10 ^ 8)) / (405 x 10 ^ -9) ≈ 4.91 × 10 ^ −19 J

2. Energy of each 810 nm photon:

E_810 = ((6.626 × 10 ^ −34) ⋅ (3 × 10 ^ 8)) / (810 x 10 ^ -9) ≈ 2.46 × 10 ^ −19 J

Multiply by 2:

2 ⋅ E_810 ≈ 4.91 × 10 ^ −19 J

🎯 Energy is conserved. One violet photon = two infrared photons.

💡 So what do we really mean when we say “splits”?

We mean:

- A nonlinear crystal enables a process called Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)

- A single high-energy photon is absorbed

- Two entangled, lower-energy photons are created from the quantum field, conserving:

Energy

Momentum

Spin / angular momentum

Possibly polarization

🧠 Analogy:

Think of a 405 nm photon as a compressed spring. Inside the crystal, it releases its energy into two less tightly compressed springs (810 nm photons), which fly off in different directions but are entangled.

🌈 Color Mapping (Approximate):

[preformatted text]

Wavelength (nm) | Color                 | Energy

~400            | Violet (near-UV)      | High

~500            | Blue-Green            |  

~600            | Orange                |

~700            | Red                   | Lower

>700            | Infrared (invisible)  | Lowest

So:

405 nm = violet, energetic

810 nm = infrared, invisible, half the energy per photon

Would you like a diagram showing this conversion from one short-wavelength photon to two longer-wavelength photons, including their color and energy relationships?
