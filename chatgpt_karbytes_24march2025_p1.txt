karbytes:

Earlier in this conversation you mentioned that there have been experiments conducted which involve quantum entanglement and which seem to suggest that future events can effect past events. Please elaborate.

ChatGPT:

Yes‚Äîthis is one of the most fascinating and controversial areas in the foundations of quantum physics. The idea that future events can affect past events is often referred to as retrocausality, and it‚Äôs been explored through both thought experiments and actual quantum experiments, especially those involving quantum entanglement, delayed choice, and quantum eraser setups.

Let‚Äôs break this down with a few key experiments:

üîπ 1. Delayed Choice Experiment (Wheeler‚Äôs Delayed Choice)

Setup:

- Proposed by physicist John Archibald Wheeler in the 1970s.

- A photon is sent through a double-slit-like apparatus.

- After the photon has passed the slit(s), the experimenter chooses whether to observe which path it took or allow it to interfere like a wave.

Weird part:

- The choice to observe or not can be made after the photon has already passed the slits.

- Yet the results behave as though the photon "knew" ahead of time what the experimenter would choose.

Implication:

- Some interpretations suggest that the future measurement choice determines the past behavior of the photon.

üîπ 2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

This is a more developed version of Wheeler‚Äôs delayed choice.

Setup:

- Entangled photon pairs are created.

- One photon goes directly to a detector (we'll call it the "signal photon").

- The other photon (the "idler") takes a longer, more complex path where experimenters may or may not erase which-path information after the signal photon has already been detected.

Weird part:

- If the which-path information is erased for the idler, the signal photon (already detected) shows an interference pattern.

- If the which-path info is preserved, the interference disappears‚Äîeven though the signal photon has already hit the detector.

Implication:

- Again, it looks as though a future action (erasing or not erasing) affects what already happened to the other photon.

üîπ 3. Entanglement and Bell Test Experiments

Bell test experiments are used to test whether quantum entanglement allows for ‚Äúhidden variables‚Äù that pre-determine outcomes.

Setup:

- Two entangled particles are sent to distant detectors.

- Experimenters randomly choose measurement settings after the particles are in flight.

Weird part:

- The results are correlated in ways that violate Bell inequalities, suggesting non-locality or retrocausality‚Äîdepending on your interpretation.

Implication:

- Some interpretations (like the retrocausal interpretation) propose that the measurement setting in the future could be influencing the state of the particle in the past.

üîπ Interpretations That Allow Retrocausality

These experiments don‚Äôt prove retrocausality, but they are compatible with it, depending on the framework:

- Transactional Interpretation (by John Cramer): Uses a "handshake" between past and future waves (retarded and advanced waves).

- Two-State Vector Formalism (Aharonov and Vaidman): Describes quantum systems as being determined by both past and future boundary conditions.

- Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics: Proposes the laws of physics work the same forwards and backwards in time.

üß† So, Can the Future Really Affect the Past?

The mainstream view is no, in the sense of classical causality‚Äîbut quantum mechanics allows for strange correlations that challenge our intuition about time and causation. Whether those imply true retrocausality or just non-local correlations depends on your chosen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Would you like me to illustrate any of these experiments visually or with a specific timeline example?

karbytes:

What do you mean by non-local correlations?

ChatGPT:

Great question.

üß© Non-local correlations refer to the idea that two or more quantum particles can display instantaneous, coordinated behavior, even when separated by large distances‚Äîwithout any signal traveling between them at or below the speed of light.

This phenomenon is most famously seen in quantum entanglement.

üîó Example of Non-Local Correlations

Let‚Äôs say you have two entangled particles: A and B.

- They're created together in a way that their properties are linked (e.g., their spins must be opposite).

- You send particle A to Alice on Earth and particle B to Bob on the Moon.

Now suppose Alice measures the spin of particle A and finds it‚Äôs ‚Äúup.‚Äù

- Instantly, she knows Bob will find particle B‚Äôs spin to be ‚Äúdown.‚Äù

This result is correlated. But here‚Äôs the kicker:

- It doesn‚Äôt matter how far apart Alice and Bob are.

- The result is instantaneous, despite the fact that no signal can travel faster than light.

üö´ Why It‚Äôs Not Classical Communication

This does not allow for faster-than-light communication because:

- The outcome is random. Alice can‚Äôt control what result she gets to send a message to Bob.

- Bob‚Äôs result is also random‚Äîbut correlated with Alice‚Äôs if they compare notes after the fact.

üéØ Bell's Theorem and "Spooky Action"

Einstein called this ‚Äúspooky action at a distance,‚Äù and tried to explain it using ‚Äúhidden variables‚Äù‚Äîpre-determined outcomes.

But Bell‚Äôs Theorem (1964) proved that:

- Any hidden-variable theory that preserves local realism cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.

And experiments (called Bell test experiments) have repeatedly confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, violating Bell inequalities.

This strongly suggests one of two things:

- Locality is violated (non-locality is real).

- Reality isn't determined until measurement (i.e., outcomes are fundamentally indeterminate until observed).

üîÑ Non-Locality vs. Retrocausality

Here‚Äôs the subtle difference:

- Non-locality means: The measurement on one particle is correlated with another, instantly, at a distance.

- Retrocausality suggests: A future measurement influences a past event.

Some interpretations see non-local correlations as evidence of retrocausal influence instead of ‚Äúspooky action.‚Äù

Would you like me to draw a visual or step-by-step timeline of an entanglement example showing these non-local effects?

karbytes:

How about describe in detail the hardware and specific events which occurred during the experiments you described.

ChatGPT:

Certainly! Let's delve into the hardware and specific events of key experiments that explore quantum phenomena like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement, particularly focusing on Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment and the Quantum Eraser Experiment.

1. Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment

Objective: To investigate whether the behavior of a photon (as a wave or particle) is determined at the point of measurement, even if the decision on how to measure is made after the photon has entered the experimental apparatus.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits individual photons toward a beam splitter.

- Beam Splitter (BS1): Splits the photon's path into two possible routes:

+ Path 1: Direct transmission.

+ Path 2: Reflection.

- Mirrors: Redirect the photons from both paths to converge at a second beam splitter (BS2).

- Second Beam Splitter (BS2): Can be inserted or removed after the photon has passed BS1:

- Inserted: Paths recombine, leading to interference patterns indicative of wave behavior.

- Removed: Paths remain separate, allowing determination of the photon's path, indicative of particle behavior.

- Detectors (D1 and D2): Placed at the output ports to record photon arrivals.

Procedure:

- A photon is emitted and encounters BS1, entering a superposition of both paths.

- While the photon is en route, the experimenter decides whether to insert or remove BS2.

- Depending on the presence of BS2:

+ BS2 Inserted: Photons exhibit interference, suggesting wave-like behavior.

+ BS2 Removed: Photons do not interfere, and their path can be determined, suggesting particle-like behavior.

Key Insight: The photon's behavior appears to be influenced by the experimental setup chosen after it has entered the apparatus, challenging classical notions of reality.

2. Quantum Eraser Experiment

Objective: To explore how "which-path" information affects interference patterns and whether erasing this information can restore interference.

Experimental Setup:

- Photon Source: A laser emits photons toward a double-slit apparatus.

- Double-Slit Apparatus: Allows photons to pass through two slits, creating potential for interference.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystal (e.g., Beta Barium Borate - BBO): Placed after the slits to induce Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), producing entangled photon pairs:

+ Signal Photon: Proceeds to a detection screen (D0).

+ Idler Photon: Directed to a separate path with additional detectors.

+ Detectors (D1, D2, D3, D4): Placed to capture idler photons, with configurations that either preserve or erase which-path information.

Procedure:

- A photon passes through the double-slit and enters the BBO crystal, producing entangled signal and idler photons.

- The signal photon travels to detector D0, forming an initial pattern.

- The idler photon is directed toward detectors D1-D4:

+ D1 & D2: Provide which-path information.

+ D3 & D4: Erase which-path information.

- By correlating detections at D0 with those at D1-D4:

+ Which-Path Known (D1/D2): No interference pattern at D0.

+ Which-Path Erased (D3/D4): Interference pattern observed at D0.

Key Insight: Erasing which-path information after detection can retroactively influence the formation of interference patterns, highlighting the non-classical nature of quantum measurement.

Hardware Components:

- Photon Sources: Lasers capable of emitting single photons.

- Beam Splitters: Devices that divide photon paths probabilistically.

- Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Materials like BBO crystals used for SPDC to generate entangled photons.

- Mirrors and Optical Fibers: Direct photon paths with precision.

- Single-Photon Detectors: Sensitive detectors (e.g., avalanche photodiodes) that register individual photon events.

- Coincidence Counters: Electronic systems that correlate detection events across multiple detectors to identify entangled photon pairs.

Specific Events in the Experiments:

- Photon Emission: A laser emits photons toward the experimental apparatus.

- Path Determination: Photons encounter beam splitters or slits, creating superpositions of possible paths.

- Entanglement Generation: In the quantum eraser setup, nonlinear crystals produce entangled photon pairs via SPDC.

- Detection: Photons are detected by single-photon detectors, with events recorded for analysis.

- Data Correlation: Coincidence counters analyze detection events to identify correlations indicative of interference or which-path information.

Conclusion:

These experiments utilize precise optical components and detection systems to explore foundational questions in quantum mechanics, revealing the intricate and often non-intuitive nature of quantum phenomena.

karbytes:

I'm still not quite getting how photons retroactively alter their trajectories in response to hardware configuration.

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs a very reasonable sticking point‚Äîyou're grappling with one of the deepest puzzles in quantum physics. Let‚Äôs break it down with a step-by-step thought process, and then we‚Äôll talk about what‚Äôs really happening (or what we think is happening).

üí° Core Idea: ‚ÄúRetroactive‚Äù Behavior Isn‚Äôt Classical

When we say a photon ‚Äúretroactively‚Äù alters its behavior, it‚Äôs not like it travels backward in time and changes its trajectory. What‚Äôs happening is this:

üß† The photon‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt seem to be ‚Äúdecided‚Äù until the measurement is made‚Äîeven if that measurement is delayed.

This means the photon doesn‚Äôt act like a particle moving through a well-defined path in spacetime the way a baseball does. Instead, it exists in a kind of superposition of possibilities until measurement.

üî¨ Let's Revisit the Quantum Eraser Setup (with Entangled Photons)

Here‚Äôs how the apparent "retrocausality" happens:

1. Photon pair is created (via SPDC in a BBO crystal):

- One photon (the signal) goes to a detector (D0).

- The other (the idler) takes a more complex path with optional ‚Äúwhich-path‚Äù info.

2. You detect the signal photon at D0.

- You record its location, but you don‚Äôt yet know whether it behaved like a wave or a particle because that depends on whether the idler photon‚Äôs path can be known or not.

3. Later, the idler photon hits a detector (D1‚ÄìD4).

- D1 & D2 preserve which-path info ‚Üí no interference when you look at D0 results linked to them.

- D3 & D4 erase which-path info ‚Üí interference emerges when you correlate those detections with D0.

4. Only after comparing correlated detection events do you see the pattern:

- You only get interference when you group the D0 hits based on D3/D4 events.

üåÄ Why This Feels Like Retrocausality

- You detected the signal photon before you determined if its entangled partner‚Äôs path info was erased.

- But grouping your data later reveals that the pattern at D0 depends on a future choice (where the idler went).

So it looks like the future is influencing the past.

üß† But Here's a Key Insight:

The photon doesn't have a classical ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù at all. The notion that it ‚Äúwent through slit A or slit B‚Äù is not well-defined until you force it to be by measuring.

- ‚ú® In quantum mechanics, the outcome is not set until it‚Äôs observed. That‚Äôs not just philosophical‚Äîexperiments show this again and again.

So, rather than thinking of the photon as ‚Äúretroactively changing,‚Äù you could say:

- The photon‚Äôs past behavior is undefined until a consistent future measurement gives it meaning.

‚öñÔ∏è Interpretational Options:

Here‚Äôs how different interpretations handle this:

[preformatted text]

Interpretation                  | Photon ‚Äúretroactively changes‚Äù?   | Explanation

Copenhagen                      | ‚ùå                                | Measurement collapses wavefunction; past is undefined before then.

Many-Worlds                     | ‚ùå                                | All possible paths happen; the measurement just tells us which branch we end up in.

Transactional Interpretation    | ‚úÖ                                | Particles exchange waves forward and backward in time to determine outcomes.

Two-State Vector                | ‚úÖ                                | The state is determined by both past and future boundary conditions.

Pilot Wave (Bohmian)            | ‚ùå (but weirdly non-local)        | The photon has a real path, but a ‚Äúpilot wave‚Äù guides it based on the whole setup.

üö´ What It‚Äôs Not:

- It‚Äôs not a case of light ‚Äúgoing backward in time‚Äù like in science fiction.

- It‚Äôs not a classical particle being affected by a future event.

It‚Äôs that the quantum description is holistic‚Äîwhat we observe depends on how we choose to measure.

Quantum Eraser Experiment ‚Äî Timing and Paths

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p0.png]

Here‚Äôs a visual walk-through of the Quantum Eraser Experiment timeline and photon paths:

- At time t0, a photon pair is created.

- The signal photon travels quickly to Detector D0, where it‚Äôs detected before anything happens to the idler.

- The idler photon takes a longer, delayed path. Eventually it hits one of D1 through D4, depending on beam splitter configurations.

+ D1/D2 preserve which-path info ‚Üí no interference.

+ D3/D4 erase which-path info ‚Üí interference appears, but only when correlating with D0.

üëâ The spooky part: Even though D0 detects its photon first, the pattern only emerges later depending on what happens to the idler.

Let me know if you'd like this exported, animated, or expanded! 

karbytes:

How is which-path information erased?

ChatGPT:

Great follow-up. The concept of erasing which-path information is at the heart of the quantum eraser experiment‚Äîand it‚Äôs not as mystical as it sounds once you break it down in terms of quantum mechanics and optical hardware.

üß† First, What Is Which-Path Information?

It‚Äôs the knowledge (or possibility of knowledge) about which of two paths a photon took in an interferometer or double-slit experiment.

- If you can know which slit or path the photon took‚Äîeven in principle‚Äîthen interference disappears.

- If there is no way to know, then interference appears, because the paths remain in a quantum superposition.

üîÑ How Can That Information Be ‚ÄúErased‚Äù?

Let‚Äôs talk about the most common method: entangled photon pairs and beamsplitters.

üîß Setup Overview (from the Quantum Eraser Experiment)

You have:

- A signal photon going to detector D0.

- An idler photon going through a series of beamsplitters and mirrors leading to D1, D2, D3, or D4.

Here‚Äôs what happens at each:

[preformatted text]

Detector | What Happens                                                | Path Knowledge | Interference?

D1       | Photon takes a path that uniquely identifies slit A         | Known          | ‚ùå

D2       | Photon takes a path that uniquely identifies slit B         | Known          | ‚ùå

D3       | Photon takes a path that could‚Äôve come from A or B (50/50)  | Unknown        | ‚úÖ

D4       | Same as D3, but different phase                             | Unknown        | ‚úÖ

üß© So How Is the Info ‚ÄúErased‚Äù?

- Beamsplitters create a superposition of paths: when an idler photon hits certain beamsplitters, it becomes fundamentally impossible to tell which slit it originally came from.

- The photon's quantum state becomes a mix of both possibilities (a superposition).

- That uncertainty erases the which-path info.

üß† It‚Äôs not about deleting a record, it‚Äôs about ensuring that no record was ever made that distinguishes the paths.

üéØ Analogy: The Shuffled Mailbox

Imagine you get a letter from someone, but it's routed through a mail system where the final envelope gives no clue which sender it came from. That‚Äôs like the beamsplitter ‚Äúscrambling‚Äù the info‚Äîit‚Äôs fundamentally unknowable, not just unknown.

üí¨ What Does This Mean for the Signal Photon?

- The pattern you see at D0 (signal photon detector) depends on whether the idler photon‚Äôs which-path info is preserved or erased.

- But you can only see this after you sort the D0 data according to the idler‚Äôs detection result.

üì° Hardware That Makes This Happen

- Polarizers or wave plates may rotate photon polarization so it becomes indistinct.

- Beamsplitters randomly route photons so you can‚Äôt tell which input path they came from.

- Coincidence counters correlate signal and idler photons so the data can be sorted.

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_34/main/chatgpt_generated_image_24march2025_p1.png]

Here‚Äôs a diagram showing how the beamsplitter erases which-path information for the D3 and D4 detectors:

- Slit A and Slit B each send photons into the same beamsplitter.

- That beamsplitter sends the photon with 50/50 probability to either D3 or D4.

- Because both slits contribute to both detectors indistinguishably, there is no way to know which slit the photon came from.

üß† Result: The original path is fundamentally unknowable ‚Üí interference is restored in the signal photon‚Äôs pattern (when correlated with D3/D4 events).

Here‚Äôs a diagram showing how which-path information is preserved in the D1 and D2 detector case:

- Slit A leads exclusively to Detector D1.

- Slit B leads exclusively to Detector D2.

- Because each path is uniquely identifiable, you can tell which slit the idler photon came from.

üß† Result: The which-path info is preserved ‚Üí the signal photon does not produce an interference pattern.

I would like to know more about how data from D0 is sorted to reveal interference patterns only in erased cases.

ChatGPT:

Perfect‚Äîthis touches on the subtle and beautiful logic of the quantum eraser experiment:

- You only see interference when you group the signal photon detections at D0 according to whether the idler‚Äôs which-path info was erased.

Let‚Äôs walk through exactly how that sorting works:

üß≠ Step-by-Step Breakdown

üîπ 1. Each photon pair is tagged by a shared ID

- When a photon pair (signal + idler) is created, the experiment tracks them as a coincident event using a coincidence counter.

- This allows researchers to know:

+ ‚ÄúThis photon detected at D0 is entangled with that one detected at D1/D2/D3/D4.‚Äù

üîπ 2. All signal photons hit D0 in the same place

- Regardless of what happens to the idler photon, all signal photons are detected at D0.

- By themselves, these hits look random‚Äîno interference is visible in the raw D0 data.

üîπ 3. D0 data is separated into subgroups based on idler outcomes

The real magic happens during analysis:

- After enough photons are detected, the experimenter groups the D0 detections based on which detector (D1, D2, D3, D4) caught the entangled idler photon.

You get:

[preformatted text]

Group | Idler Detector | Path Info Known? | D0 Pattern

A     | D1             | Known (Slit A)   | No interference

B     | D2             | Known (Slit B)   | No interference

C     | D3             | Unknown          | Interference pattern ‚ë†

D     | D4             | Unknown          | Interference pattern ‚ë°

- Groups A & B: You can trace the path ‚Üí no wave-like behavior.

- Groups C & D: You cannot know the path ‚Üí interference appears‚Äîbut only within that subgroup.

üåÄ The "Which Interference Pattern" Bit

- The patterns seen in D0 for D3 and D4 are complementary:

+ D3 might produce one type of interference fringe.

+ D4 produces the inverse or phase-shifted version.

- When all D0 data is added together, these patterns cancel out, leaving no net interference in the raw D0 detections.

So:

üîç Only after sorting by idler outcome does the hidden interference reveal itself.

üß† Why This Matters

This means the pattern is not in the photons themselves, but in the relationship between the two entangled photons‚Äîa kind of quantum bookkeeping that only makes sense when you analyze their correlation.

- The interference isn‚Äôt erased‚Äîit‚Äôs just hidden until you sort the data properly.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware That Makes This Possible

[preformatted text]

Component | Purpose

Single-photon detectors (D0‚ÄìD4) | Record precise time and position of each photon hit

Time-tagging electronics        | Logs timestamps for each detection

Coincidence counter             | Matches D0 events to corresponding D1‚ÄìD4 detections

Data analysis software          | Sorts D0 hits into subgroups for interference analysis

üìä Visualization Suggestion

Imagine a scatter plot of all D0 hits. It looks random.

But if you:

- Filter out just the hits that correspond to D3 events ‚Üí ‚ú®interference!

- Filter by D1 or D2 ‚Üí just a blob (no interference).

- Combine all hits again ‚Üí interference cancels out.

Would you like me to generate a simulated plot to show what this sorting and grouping would look like visually?

How are photon paths randomized in these experiments?

ChatGPT:

Excellent question‚Äîphoton path randomization is a critical part of these quantum experiments because it ensures that which-path information is either preserved or erased in a controlled, probabilistic way. Let‚Äôs break down how this is achieved:

üß™ How Photon Paths Are Randomized

üîπ 1. Beamsplitters (BS)

The most common tool for randomizing photon paths is the 50/50 beamsplitter:

- It‚Äôs a half-silvered mirror.

- When a photon hits it:

+ There's a 50% chance it is transmitted.

+ And a 50% chance it is reflected.

- This behavior is inherently quantum‚Äîthe photon enters a superposition of being reflected and transmitted until measured.

üß† This is key: The photon doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdecide‚Äù which path to take. It behaves as if it takes both paths simultaneously until a detection collapses the state.

üîπ 2. Entangled Photon Superpositions

In many quantum eraser setups:

- A photon pair is generated in an entangled state, such that information about one photon is probabilistically related to the other.

- The idler photon is routed through a system where beamsplitters randomly direct it toward detectors:

+ D1/D2: direct paths ‚Üí known origin (which-path preserved).

+ D3/D4: mixed paths via beamsplitters ‚Üí origin scrambled (which-path erased).

üí° The randomization occurs because the entangled photon interacts with optical elements that don't distinguish between the original source paths.

üîπ 3. Quantum Superposition Instead of Classical Randomness

This isn‚Äôt like flipping a coin.

- In classical terms, you might think the photon already chose a path‚Äîjust hidden from you.

- But in quantum mechanics, the photon truly has no definite path until a measurement is made.

This is what‚Äôs called:

- "Path indeterminacy through quantum superposition"

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware That Introduces Random Paths

Component                              | Role in Randomization

50/50 Beamsplitter                     | Sends photons to different detectors with equal probability

Polarizing Beamsplitter                | Sends photons based on polarization (which can be quantum-random)

Wave Plates (e.g., quarter-wave)       | Rotate polarization, making the outcome probabilistically dependent

Nonlinear Optical Crystals (like BBO)  | Produce entangled pairs in superpositions of spatial or polarization states

Delay Lines / Fiber Loops              | Adjust path lengths so decisions can be made after other events (enabling delayed choice)

üé≤ So What Does ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù Mean Here?

It means the path the photon takes is governed by quantum probabilities, not hidden classical variables. The photon doesn‚Äôt "choose" its path in the classical sense‚Äîit‚Äôs as if it explores all possible paths simultaneously until detection forces a single outcome.

Photon Path Randomization via 50/50 Beamsplitter

Here‚Äôs a diagram illustrating how a 50/50 beamsplitter randomizes a photon's path:

- An incoming photon hits the beamsplitter.

- It has an equal probability of:

+ Being transmitted ‚Üí takes Path A.

+ Being reflected ‚Üí takes Path B.

But here‚Äôs the quantum twist:

üí° Before detection, the photon is in a superposition of both paths simultaneously. Only when it hits a detector does one outcome become real.

How are the photons entangled in these experiments?

ChatGPT:

Awesome question‚Äîand this is where things get especially fascinating on both a conceptual and technical level.

üß¨ In a nutshell:

Photons are entangled in quantum eraser experiments through a process called Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). This is done using nonlinear optical crystals, like Beta Barium Borate (BBO).

Let‚Äôs break this down in clear steps:

üîπ What is Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)?

SPDC is a quantum optical process where:

- A high-energy photon (usually from a laser, called a pump photon) enters a nonlinear crystal.

- Inside the crystal, one photon splits into two lower-energy photons.

- These two photons are:

+ Created simultaneously.

+ Quantum entangled in one or more degrees of freedom (like polarization, momentum, energy, or position).

These two resulting photons are called:

- Signal photon

- Idler photon

They are not just correlated‚Äîthey are entangled, meaning their properties are linked in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics.

üß™ How It‚Äôs Done in the Lab

1. Photon Source (Pump Laser)

- A UV laser (often around 405 nm) fires photons into the crystal.

- These photons are much higher energy than the resulting photon pairs.

2. Nonlinear Crystal (e.g., BBO)

- This crystal has special optical properties that allow for down-conversion.

- One pump photon is converted into two entangled infrared photons (often around 810 nm each).

- There are two types of SPDC setups:

+ Type I: Both output photons have the same polarization.

+ Type II: Output photons have orthogonal polarizations (e.g., one horizontal, one vertical).

3. Phase Matching & Angle Control

- The crystal is aligned so that the emitted photon pairs exit at specific angles‚Äîusually forming two cones of light that intersect.

- Entangled pairs are collected at points where the cones overlap.

üéØ What Aspects of the Photons Are Entangled?

Depending on the setup, entanglement can occur in:

[preformatted text]

Entanglement Type  | Description

Polarization       | Photon A is horizontal ‚Üí Photon B is vertical (and vice versa)

Momentum/Direction | Photon A goes left ‚Üí Photon B goes right

Energy-Time        | If you know photon A's energy or arrival time precisely, you know B‚Äôs too

Position           | Used in ghost imaging and double-slit setups

In most quantum eraser experiments, the entanglement is in polarization and/or momentum, which allows for interference patterns to be influenced by measurements on the idler photon.

üîÑ Example Entangled State (Polarization)

The pair might be in a state like this:

‚à£œà‚ü© = (1 / square_root(2)) * (( ‚à£H‚ü©_1 * ‚à£V‚ü©_2 ) + ( ‚à£V‚ü©_1 * ‚à£H‚ü©_2 ))

Where:

‚à£H‚ü© = horizontal polarization

‚à£V‚ü© = vertical polarization

Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the signal and idler photons.

In this state, if you measure one photon as horizontally polarized, the other will always be vertical‚Äîand vice versa‚Äîbut you won‚Äôt know which until you measure.

Are the masses of the two "new" photons each the same mass as the one "old" photon they emerged from? 

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs an insightful question‚Äîbecause it highlights one of the key differences between how energy and mass behave in quantum optics.

üß≠ Short Answer:

No, the two new photons do not have the same mass as the original photon‚Äîbecause all of them have zero rest mass.

üì° Let‚Äôs break it down:

üîπ Photons Have Zero Rest Mass

- Photons are massless particles in terms of rest mass.

- Their energy is related to their frequency by this equation:

E = h * f

Where:

E is energy,

h is Planck‚Äôs constant,

f is frequency.

üîπ What Changes in SPDC?

In spontaneous parametric down-conversion:

- A high-energy pump photon (e.g., 405 nm) is absorbed by a nonlinear crystal.

- It ‚Äúsplits‚Äù into two lower-energy photons (e.g., each 810 nm).

- These new photons are called the signal and idler photons.

‚úÖ Energy Conservation:

E_pump = E_signal + E_idler

Each daughter photon has less energy, hence lower frequency (longer wavelength).

üî∏ Momentum Is Also Conserved:

Even though photons are massless, they still carry momentum:

p = E / c = (h * f) / c = h / Œª

So momentum conservation also applies:

p_pump = p_signal + p_idler

That‚Äôs why the photons emerge at complementary angles forming conical emission patterns from the crystal.

üß¨ Mass ‚â† Energy in This Case

If you‚Äôre thinking in terms of Einstein‚Äôs famous equation:

E = m * (c ^ 2)

You might wonder: Does a change in energy mean a change in mass?

- That equation applies to rest energy for particles with rest mass.

- Photons always move at the speed of light and have zero rest mass, so this doesn‚Äôt apply in the usual way.

- Instead, photon energy is fully expressed as radiative (kinetic) energy, not mass.

üß† Bottom Line:

- Original photon: mass = 0, energy = E = h * f

- Two new photons: each mass = 0, energy = h * f_1 and h * f_2

- Total energy and momentum are conserved

- No change in rest mass occurs, because there was no rest mass to begin with.
